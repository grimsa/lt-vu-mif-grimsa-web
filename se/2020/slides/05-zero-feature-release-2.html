## Quality assurance

---
## Quality

- Many [alternative definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality#Definitions)
--
- Basically:
    - Quality = is fit for purpose and satisfies expectations

---
## Quality assurance

> To quell a widespread misunderstanding, software quality assurance is **not testing**.
> Software quality assurance (SQA) is **a set of activities** that define and assess the adequacy of software processes to provide **evidence that establishes confidence**
> that the software processes are appropriate and produce software products of **suitable quality** for their intended purposes.
> <br><br>— <cite>SWEBOK 3.0</cite>

--
- Not (only) testing - everything we do to ensure proper quality
--
- The goal is to create evidence proving that software is "good enough"

---
## Quality assurance

- Covers both
    - Prevention of defects
    - Detection and correction of defects
--
- Some examples
    - Adhering to standards and proven processes
--
    - Reviewing various artifacts
--
    - Using formal methods
--
    - Testing
--
- **Testing** is the primary vehicle for quality assurance

---
## Software testing

- Everyone who develops software does testing
--
- Testing is *running* the program with *selected inputs* and checking that *actual* results match *expectations*
--
- We can do it *at random* or *systematically*

---
## Example: Print constant text

```
class MyProgram {
    public static void main() {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

--
- Always behaves the same way
--
- Expected output: constant `Hello, world!`
--

Testing is trivial

---
## Example: Twice the number

`<T extends Number> T twice(T number)`

--
- `T` is `Byte`
   - Inputs [-128; 127]
   - 256 different input values
--
- `T` is `Long`
   - Inputs [–9,223,372,036,854,775,808; 9,223,372,036,854,775,807]
   - 1.8E19 different input values
--
- `T` is `BigInteger`
   - Input space: (loosely) infinite
--

Testing with all inputs is not **possible** or **feasible**

---
## Input selection

- How do we choose which inputs to test with?
--
    - *Test case* = particular choice of input data + expected outcome
--
- Random selection is not efficient
--
- Fundamental idea
    - Correct results for tested inputs should be representative of correct results for untested inputs
--
- There are heuristics that help us choose (*test case design*)
--
    - Equivalence groups (black-box)
    - Boundaries (black-box)
    - Control flow (white-box)
    - States (white-box)
---
## Equivalence groups

Test cases for `int sqare(int number)`?

--

Idea
- A fault in code often affects a whole group of similar inputs
- It's unlikely that values within the same group of similar inputs produce different results

--

Therefore
1. Partition input space into logical equivalence groups
2. Choose input values from each group

---
## Boundary conditions

Test cases for `int sqare(int number)`?

--

Idea
- Faults are more likely at the boundaries of equivalence groups
    - E.g. confusion between `>` and `>=`, and other *off-by-one errors*

--

Therefore
- Choose input values at the boundaries
- Choose "special" values (`null`, `0`, min/max values, etc.)

---
## Control flow

```
public static int foo(int a, int b) {
    int result = 5;
    if (a > 15) {
        result = a;
    }
    return b > 10
       ? result + b
       : result - b; 
}
```

--

Idea
- A piece of code has a finite number of different paths through it

--

Therefore
- Choose inputs that exercise every path

---
## More examples

- `Set<Polygon> splitIntoEqualAreas(Polygon p)`
--
- `List<Route> route(Point from, Point to)`
--
- `List<SearchResult> google(String query, User u)`
--
- `Img style(Img source, F<Img, Img> transform)`

---
## In practice

- With testing we cannot prove absence of defects
--
- Any nontrivial system will not be tested completely
--
- The more we test
    - The more *confidence* we have in the quality of the system
--
    - The more *time* and *money* we spend
--
- Goal is to discover *important* defects as quickly and cheaply as possible
--
- Test design is difficult

---
## Tests in development

- Let's say we have a number of test cases for our system
--
- We want to execute test cases after every change
--
 (*regression testing*)
--
- **Manual testing gets expensive very quickly**

---
## Test automation

- Idea
    - Write short programs/scripts that exercise system under test and check if expectations are met
--
- There are tools, libraries and framewroks that facilitate this

---
## Example: JUnit

```
class VatRateTest {
    @Test
    void defaultRate_lithuania_correctValue() {
        VatRate rate = new VatRate("LT");

        BigDecimal actualResult = rate.defaultRate();

        BigDecimal expectedResult = new BigDecimal("0.21");
        assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult);
    }

    // other test cases
}
```
--
- Test <span style="color: chartreuse">passes</span> if expectation is met
--
- Test <span style="color: red">fails</span> if it expectation is not met
--
    - Failures are what we want!

---
## Test levels

- Testing can be performed at [various levels](https://www.test-institute.org/Software_Testing_Levels.php)

???
- Low-level tests
    - Are simpler and easier to write, and run faster (we can have more)
    - Require changes when low-level details change
    - Provide less confidence
- High-level tests
    - Provide more confidence
    - More stable
    - More difficult to write and maintain, execute much longer

???
- Demo: JUnit (utils, controller), Postman

---
## Key takeaways

- Testing is the primary means of quality assurance
--
- Testing a system completely is not realistic
--
- Testing can find defects, but not prove absence of them
--
- Test cases should be chosen deliberately to maximize coverage and minimize cost
--
- Manual testing is very expensive; automation helps make it just expensive
--
- Different types of tests exists; most can be automated

---

# CI/CD

---
## Basic problem
<br>
.center[**Source code**]

.center[|]
.center[*????*]
.center[↓]

.center[**Software available to end-user**]

--
<br>
<br>
.center[Ideally, instantly and automatically]

---
## Two main steps

.center[**Source code**]

.center[|]
.center[*build and package*]
.center[↓]

.center[**Some binary artifact**]

.center[|]
.center[*deploy*]
.center[↓]

.center[**Software available to end-user**]

???
Last time we talked about build tools. Let's take it further.

---
class: center, middle

### CI

---
## Continuous integration (CI)

An almost universally used practice.

--
- Maintain a code repository
--
- Commit to baseline often
--
- Build every commit to baseline automatically
--
- The build should be fast and self-testing
--
- Make everyone aware of the results of the latest build
--
- Make the artifacts produced accessible for use, testing and deployment

???
Minimize "work in progress".
Tests block integration.
Fixing a failing build is - top priority.

Demo:
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/equipment-definition-service/pull/174 - failing build

---
## Build infrastructure

- Build server - dedicated machine
    - Executes builds, runs tests, performs static code analysis, etc.
    - Maintains status/history, and notifies developers

???
Demo: Jenkins

---
class: center, middle

### CD

---
## Deployment environment

- An environment where (into which) a software package is deployed
--
- This can include
    - Hardware
    - Operating system
    - Any required software
    - Any required configuration
---

## Typical environments used

<img src="../../assets/10-envs.svg" style="margin: -50pt 0 -50pt 60pt" width="90%">

--
- Local/Development
    - Developer's own environment
--
- Integration/Test
    - Latest baseline build deployed automatically
--
- Staging/Acceptance/Pre-production
    - Production replica for release candidate testing or production troubleshooting
--
- Production/Live
    - Main environment with real users

---
## Trend 1: Machines

<img src="../../assets/10-vms.svg" width="90%">

---
## Trend 2: Infrastructure as code

- Trend
    - From one-off servers
--
    - Towards standard machines using commodity hardware
--
    - Towards managing and provisioning servers through config files
        - Rather than physically configuring machines using interactive tools
--
- Notice the same goal: save time and reduce errors
--
- Enabler: apply development practices to config files
    - Files can be versioned, branched, reviewed, released, etc.
--
- Example ([Terraform](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/master/examples/two-tier/main.tf))

???
Example: https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/aws-infrastructure/blob/master/cloudformation/6.rds.yaml

---
## Deployment today

- Containers are the primary vehicle of deployment
    - *Docker* being the primary (underlying) runtime
--
- Container benefits
    - Less overhead
    - Increased portability
    - Developer productivity
--
- Deployed either on container services
    - e.g. AWS Elastic Container Service, Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Container Service
--
- ... or on own infrastructure, defined as code

???
Demo:
- Dockerfile
- ECR and maybe ECS

---
## Continuous delivery/deployment

- Expand on ideas of CI
--
- Both referred to as CD
--
- Continuous delivery
    - Every working version **can be** depoyed
--
- Continuous deployment
    - Every working version **is** deployed

???
- Demo: Deployment of some service to prod

---
## Benefits of CD

- Faster time to market
--
- Lower risk of failed releases
--
- Higher degree of automation
--
- Happier teams

---
## Build infrastructure evolution

1. Manually configured dedicated build server(s)
--
1. Build process defined as code
--
1. Server infrastructure defined as code
--
1. Desired service defined as code

???
- Early days - Jenkins with manual config
- Why pay for server that you are not using?
- Demo: GitLab CI / CD (and limitations), GitHub Actions; push slides, see they are updated

---
## Key takeaways

- Two main phases: building some artifact and then deploying it
--
- Multiple environments and a CI/CD pipelines make things easier
--
- Main goal behind automation: save time and reduce errors
--
- Version control systems are a common theme/enabler
--
- Once again, declarative configuration is both attractive and popular
