class: middle, center
## Version control systems

---
## The need

> SE = "Multi-person construction of multi-version software."

--
Notice some challenges...
--
- Multi-person
    - Who has the latest version of file X?
    - Can I edit file X today?
    - What changed yesterday?
--
- Multi-version
    - What changed between version 1.0 and 1.2?
    - Who wrote this!?!
    - Is there a reason why it is like it is?

---
## There's a tool for that

**Version control systems** - software tools that help manage changes to source code over time.

--
 Some benefits:
- Records a full history of all changes to all files
- Accelerates software development
- Becomes the single source of truth

---
## Key concepts

- Diff
???
Diff = Comparison between two versions
--
- Commit
???
Commit = A change set that is made permanent
--
- History
--
- Tag
--
- Branch
???
Branch - some particular (named) track of history
--
- Code review
???
Review tools:
- https://demo.reviewboard.org/r/
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/math-applications/pull/77/files

--
- Merge
???
Merge = Inclusion of changes from one branch into another

- [Git tutorial from Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
- Any other resources
    - Please share what you find!

---
## Recommended practices

- Version everything
--
    - Text-based formats are superior
--
    - Avoid storing derived/compiled resources
???
Example: these slides @ https://git.mif.vu.lt/grimsa/site
--
- Atomic commits
--
- Informative commit messages
???
Example: https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/math-applications/pull/77/files
--
- Define your workflow
    - [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
    - GitFlow (see [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow))

???
Start using VCS in your group projects

---
## State of the practice

- Every non-throwaway project uses VCS
--
- Dominant VCS
    - git
    - Others: SVN, Mercurial, CVS, Jazz, etc.
???
Random post on the internet: ~70% market share in 2020
--
- Dominant git repository hosting:
    - [GitHub](https://github.com)
    - [GitLab (public)](https://gitlab.com)
    - [GitLab (VU)](https://git.mif.vu.lt)
---
## VCS in practice

(Demo)

???
- Early history of `sdtmain` project
- Recent history of `permit-ready` service
- Archeology:
    - https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/master/logback-access/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/access/spi/AccessEvent.java
    - Search Image suppressed
    - Blame twice, click on commit
    - End up here: https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/commit/69290e182f8db6589eadd5a3c485a37255384893
    - Archeology - size of codebase: IDEA search for "\n" regex
    - Post about it: https://www.se-radio.net/2009/11/episode-148-software-archaeology-with-dave-thomas/

## High-level design

---
## The basic problem: how?

.center[Requirements]

.center[↓]

.center[????]

.center[↓]

.center[Code]

---
## It depends

- Small and simple problems
    - Solved with little attention to design
--
- Big and difficult problems
    - Design largely determines how complex software can become

---
## Design

> 1. [**process**] to define the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system element.
> 2. **Result** of the process in (1).
> <br><br>— <cite>Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary, ISO 24765:2017</cite>

---
## Why is design essential for system's success?

- Code is only limited by what people can imagine
--
- However, [human mind is very limited](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/transcending-the-limitations-of-the-human-mind/)
???
How big a codebase can one developer know deeply. 100k LoC?

---
## Models to the rescue

> A model **represents some aspect of reality** or an idea that is of interest.
> A model is a **simplification**.
> It is an interpretation of reality that **abstracts** the aspects
> relevant to solving the problem at hand and **ignores extraneous detail**.
> <br><br>— <cite>Eric Evans, [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design), 2003</cite>

???
A model is an abstraction.
Paralell with memory of some event - "what did you do on the day of your last birthday"? You only remember key details.

---
## More on models

- A model is merely a human construct to help us better understand the real world
--
- We can model what was, what is, and **what could be**

---
## More on design

- Design is about defining (modelling) a system or system element so that it:
    - achieves the goals
    - satisfies constraints
    - has other desired qualities
--
- Design can be done at different levels
    - With different goals
???
Design a building, design a lecture hall, design a door handle, design a screw
--
- There are always multiple alternative viable designs
--
- The goal is to choose the best one
    - Analogy with planning - selecting the best possible future

---
## What does design help with?

- Mitigating risks
--
- Communicating, discussing, and validating ideas
--
- Decomposing and delegating work
--
- Construction

???
For group projects drawing a deployment diagram can achieve 1-2, and possibly even 3

---
## How to communicate design?

- In a free form
    - Diagrams and drawings
    - Text
    - Tables
--
- Using standard notation
    - **[Unified Modelling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)**
    - [The C4 model](https://c4model.com/)

???
We will only be looking at UML in this course, and only at a subset of diagrams.
---
## UML deployment diagram

- Static structure of the system at a very high level
--
- Models physical nodes and what artifacts are deployed on them
--
- A few examples:
    - [Clustered webapp](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/web-application-clusters-uml-deployment-diagram-example.html?context=depl-examples)
    - [Small system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram#/media/File:Deployment_Diagram.PNG)
    - [Clustered webapp](https://sites.google.com/site/kampaaniad2016/3-projekt/3-6-uml-deployment-diagram)
    - [Android app](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Deployment-Diagram-for-the-BBS-Android-application_fig6_323704711)

???
- Also show examples from last year

## Tips for choosing technologies

> The best framework is the one you already know.
> <br><br>— <cite>Folklore</cite>

--
<br>

> Choose boring technology.
> <br><br>— <cite>Dan McKinley ([blog post](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology), [slide deck](http://boringtechnology.club/))</cite>

--
Leverage free hosted services
???
- VU resources
- Netlify
- AWS
- https://jsonbin.io/
- etc.

---

## Key takeaways

- Version control systems - what they are, and what practices are universally recommended
--
- What are models
--
- What is design (both as an activity and as a thing) and why do we need it
--
- How UML deployment diagrams can be used to describe the mapping of artifacts to nodes

---
## Reading assignment

Mandatory:

- GitFlow workflow ([blog post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow))
- [Blog post: Transcending limitations of the human mind](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/transcending-the-limitations-of-the-human-mind/)

Recommended:

- [Talk: Pragmatic architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNgZtM6SQmE)

???
We did not talk much about architecture, but you could try out architect's role while doing high-level design
