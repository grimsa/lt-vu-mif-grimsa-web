# Software Engineering
Design, UML class diagrams

---
## Plan

- Today:
    - Designing static structure
- Next:
    - Designing dynamic structure (interactions)
???
Let's talk about the design activity and practice communicating our designs using UML class diagrams.

---
## Recap: The basic problem - how?

## Recap: [High-level design](http://klevas.mif.vu.lt/~grimsa/se/2020/slides/03-vcs-design-deployment.html#28)

- Design — a process to define the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system element, as well as the result of that process
--
- A designer generates alternative designs and evaluates them
--
- Model — a simplified representation of something, having enough details that help solve some problem, at the same time hiding all other details that do not
--
- How to communicate the design?
    - In free form
    - Or using standard notation (UML)
???
We'll be talking about UML going forward.

---
## Qualities of a good design

- First of all, it must fulfil the requirements
--
- Then, it should both:
    - Help **manage complexity**
    - Support distribution of work
    - Support future changes
--
- All of the above lead to *modularity* and *separation of responsibilities*

???
- Recall: limitations of the human mind

## [Demo](https://github.com/grimsa/practice--poker-hands/)

---
## UML class diagram

Describes:
- static structure (classes in an OO system)
- (optionally) their attributes and methods
- connections between classes

???
Agnostic to programming language used.

--

Does not describe:
- details of how the classes interact with each other
- how methods are implemented (algorithmic details)

---
## Some guidelines for OO design

- Classes representing the domain model should do all domain work
    - Rich (instead of anemic) domain model
--
- Focus on responsibilities and behaviour, not on data
    - Anthropomorphism
--
- Hide implementation details
    - Encapsulation
--
- Avoid duplication (DRY)
    - A change should be limited to one place
--
- Prefer composition over inheritance

---
## Some more about information hiding

- Fundamental cost in SE is accomodating change
--
- A change that modifies multiple components is more costly than a change that is isolated in a single component
--
- Therefore, define
    - interfaces that capture stable aspects
--
    - implementations that capture changeable aspects
--
- Recommended: [Parnas: On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/05/on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules/)

---
## Caveat

- You cannot create a design that anticipates **all** changes
--
    - Analogy with car engine maintenance
--
- Therefore, anticipate **likely** changes

---
## So what can we hide?

- Algorithms
???
Sort
--
- Data representations
???
Encodings, XML/JSON
--
- Sources of information
???
COVID statistics
--
- Hardware specifics
???
Plug and play: same interface / different drivers (implementations)
--
- Specifics of external API or external domain
???
E.g. external API: file name must be 8 symbols or fewer.

## Bezos API mandate

- Internal memo at Amazon (~2002) by Jeff Bezos (CEO)
--
- Best known from when an ex-Amazon employee accidentally posted his rant to a wider audience
--
- Secondary sources:
    - [Just the API mandate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18916406)
    - [Same with more context](https://gigaom.com/2011/10/12/419-the-biggest-thing-amazon-got-right-the-platform/) 

---
## Bezos API mandate

> - **All teams will henceforth expose** their data and functionality through **service interfaces**.
--
> - Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
--
> - There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. **The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.**

---
## Bezos API mandate (2)

> - It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, CORBA, PubSub, custom protocols -- doesn't matter. Bezos doesn't care.
--
> - **All service interfaces, without exception, must be** designed from the ground up to be **externalizable**. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
--
> - Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.

--

Notice principles:
- Information hiding
- Reusability

---
## Key takeaways

- Decomposition: top-down works better than bottom-up
--
- Mindset and principles of design
--
- Qualities of a good design
