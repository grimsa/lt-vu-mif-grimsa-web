# Communication in general

---
## Communication

- Idea → transport → idea
???
Karjeros pradžioj - nueini pas seniorą paklausi ir supranti
Ištransliavus sau - atrodo kitaip - rubber duck
--
- Losses everywhere!
???
- Netiksliai išsireiškiau
- Autocorrect'as ištaisė / ne viską užkrovė / ne viską perskaitė
- Ne taip perskaitė
- Ne taip suprato (sąvokos/mental modeliai skirtingi)
--
- Competing ideas everywhere!
???
Other ideas competing for attention
--
- Goal: getting the *right* idea across

---
## Forms of communication

- Spoken
    - Convesations
--
    - Meetings
--
    - Talks
--
- Written
    - Chats
--
    - Emails
--
    - Documents
--
    - Articles
--
    - Books
???
Manuals, memos, meeting minutes, laws (could be spoken as well)

Remote work is moving more and more into async (written).

---
## The cost of communication

- 15 people, daily 15 min meeting = ??? EUR
???
- Then add some buffer to join/leave/get a coffee
- 20 days per month
- 50 EUR/h rate

--
- 2 people, building an app for 2 months = ??? EUR
???
- 2x 160h
Ruby app was scrapped and had to be rewritten in Java
???
Discussions - 126h this year - https://track.toggl.com/reports/summary/2253729/clients/42738614/description/Discussion/period/thisYear/users/3523559

--
- A project that is delayed... and delayed... and delayed
???
Likely a communication problem (final scope not known, or required effort not known)

--
- Two people of equivalent skill, except for communication. Salary difference?

---
## Some tips for effective communication

- Short, and to the point
???
Yra knygų - "On writing well"
--
- Every meeting should have a clear purpose, outcome, and preparation
???

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1emREo5B1MBi8YMwyc9CHuwrrzIQzfZvcIUjewReSlB8/edit
--
- Everyone should contribute their ideas to a shared pool of meaning
???
- Conflicts: push vs. pull. 2x Push = standoff
--
- Decisions should be documented and published

# Your project presentations

---
## Project presentations

- Every team will have:
    - Max 10 minutes to present
    - Followed by 5-15 minutes of Q&A
--
- Grading
    - 2 - System prototype
???
Vertinamas prototipo atitikimas paruoštiems dokumentams, kokiu mastu realizuotas prototipo funkcionalumas (ir jo sudėtingumas), stebima sistemos kokybė.

Apima:
- Tai ką, rodot ir pasakojat per pristatymą
- Ką esat rodę per pratybas
- Kas yra kodo repozitorijoje
- Kaip mainėjom, suprantam, kad ne visi projektai bus baigti

--
    - 1 - Presentation
???
Vertinamas pristatymo atitikimas parengtai dokumentacijai ir sukurtam prototipui, kokiu mastu projektas, svarbiausi projektiniai sprendimai bei komandinio darbo organizavimas yra paaiškinti, komunikacijos ir pagalbinių priemonių aiškumas.

Jei jums atrodo prasminga, man asmeniškai norėtųsi girdėti šiek tiek refleksijos

# Presenting your work

---
## Bad presentation - what?

???
Examples
--
- Irrelevant
--
- Unclear
--
- Boring
    - Wall of text
    - Repetitive
    - Monothonic
    - Dry facts
???
Reading
--
- Etc.

---
## Good presentation - how?

--
- Preparation
- Preparation
- Preparation
- Preparation
- Preparation
- Preparation
- ...
- Practice
--
- Delivery

---
## How to prepare?

--
1. Know your audience and motivation
--
1. Prepare outline
--
1. Prepare content
--
1. Plan delivery

--

.footnote[
Notice the parallel with essential software development activities
]

???
Requirements -> High-level design -> Implementation -> Deployment/Ops

---
## First: Audience

- Who is going to attend?
???
What is their backgorund?
What are they like as people?
What are they interested in?
What motivates them?

Your peers with tech background.
--
- What is valuable for them to hear/see?
???
Peers - maybe hear something interesting (knowledge sharing!)
Jury - need to see key things to be able to evaluate your project
--
- What is the occasion?
???
Formal/professional
Laid back/casual

---
## First: Your motivation

What is your primary goal?

--
- To inform
--
- To entertain
--
- To impress
--
- To persuade
--
- To challenge
--
- ...

???
Maybe you want to:
- inform what you did
- persuade that your focus are was done well
- challenge the current course format by bringing up what did not work

--

What are your secondary goals?

???
- Put in some entertaining moment

---
## Outline: Main points

- What is the central idea you want to get across?
???
You developed a functional prototype using a fairly mature development process and practices.
--
- What do you **really** want to tell?
???
- Planned scope is delivered on time and with sufficient quality
- Development process worked well (and you would recommend others to follow it)
--
- What are the main points that support the central idea?
???
Facts - we deployed 5 times a day on average; we have X test coverage.
--
- Remember that your presentation has to **create value** for the audience
???
Recall what the audience is there to see.
--
- In what order will you deliver your ideas?
--
    - Problem → arguments → conclusion
--
    - [Start with why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sioZd3AxmnE)
???
Why -> What -> How
--
    - [The Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7)
???
Conclusion → main arguments (~3) → supporting arguments (~3 each)
--
    - Main idea → supporting information → main idea
???
Hamburger

---
## Outline: Supporting information

- What facts, examples, metaphors, or stories will support your main points?
    - Nothing comes close to a good metaphor or a story
???
Short story how unit tests helped you fix some bug.
Short story how the unit tests you wrote actually made it harder to do things. (And what you learned from that)
--
- Storytelling
    - Explains abstract concepts and ideas
???
- Exposure as an octopus.
--
    - Something very human
    - Inspires, motivates, unites people
???
- Storytelling is a big thing in marketing/advertisement business. Calls to action.
--
    - A skill that can be trained
???
- Story has to have a key person that the audience can connect to (relatable); must have beginning/middle/end; should be comic (protagonist succeeds) or tragic (fails)    
--
- How will you transition from one point to the next?
???
Man padėdavo pasirašyti perėjimo sakinius

---
## Outline: Intro and conclusion

- Use introduction to
    - Hook the audience
    - Set the stage
    - Align expectations
    - Explain relevant context/background
???
Hook is the best.

Hello. My name is Gediminas and I'm very happy to be speaking here this morning. As you all know, climate change is an increasingly pressing problem to be addressed. Over the weekend, me and my team has looked at some possible solutions in great detail, and we came to the conclusion that increasing the import tax on all fossil fuels should be the best way forward.
Hello. Our solution is doubling the import tax on all fossil fuels.

Using storytelling: https://www.infoq.com/presentations/solid-case-study/
--
- Use the closing to
    - Reiterate the main idea
    - Call to action
???
Present future plans

---
## Content: Form

- Talk
--
- Live demo
--
- Recorded demo
--
- Slideshow
--
- Discussion, play, etc.

???
Pavyzdys - vietoje skaidrių - trumpas intro, ir tada kiekvienas narys po pora min papasakoja savo įžvalgas/learnings/istorijas. Iš esmės tas pats kaip skaidrės, bet much more personal

---
## Content: Principles

- *"Less is more"*
--
- *"Be brief, be bright, be gone"*
???
Jei limitas - 10 min, taikykit į 7.
Pavyzdys: Hakatone - turi 2 min pristatymui, trainingo metu 1 min, trainingo antras raundas 30s.
--
- One strong argument to justify a point
???
Kartojimas ar papildomi argumentai "atskiedžia" ir susilpnina (be to, tada opozicija gali atsakyti į silpnus argumentus).
--
- Find a balance between fact and feeling
???
Visi mes žmonės ir ryšį su kitais žmonėm ar net idėjomis kuriame per jausmus.

---
## Content: Slides

- First slide
    - A question or invitation = curious
    - Title and presenter name = usual, boring
--
- Common problems
    - Overload
--
    - Details too small
???
Wall of text or small images (!)
--
    - Speech and text at the same time
???
- Listener is not sure what to focus on
- Long quote - arba perskaityti pačiam as-is, arba duoti laiko perskaityti
--
- Works well
    - Quiet progress meter / table of contents at the bottom
???

---
## Delivery: Connect

- Tell it **as if** it's the most important thing
--
- Prefer *I* over *we*
--
- Speak for the back rows
--
- Maintain eye contact
--
- *S L O W &nbsp;&nbsp; D O W N*

???
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1snLJhzcbmSyFuV-23Lq1yhBSssN8Cpw_p2d31qYluTs/edit#slide=id.g9b07577d00_0_35

---
## Delivery: Appearance

- Appear confident and professional
--
    - Dress for occasion
--
    - Stand straight
--
    - Don't pace, don't fiddle
        - Leave a marker on the floor to remind yourself not to pace
???
Tip: standing makes it better
--
- Appear as a group
--
    - Clear responsibilities, smooth transitions
--
    - Don't attract attention unless you're speaking
--
- Rehearse
--
    - Timing with a clock
--
    - Film yourself

???
- When you move, people look at you
- When you stop, people look at screen
- Also, present to your mom, friends, etc. and ask for their feedback
---

## Delivery: Technicalities

- Presenter mode
--
- Shortcuts
    - `b`/`w` - blacks out/whites out
    - `number` - jumps to slide
--
- Avoidable technical problems
    - Test beforehand
    - Use simple and proven formats/tools/hardware

---
## Key takeaways

- Prepare - there are no shortcuts
--
- Know your audience and your goal
--
- Have a clear, simple, minimal structure
--
- Slides are only supporting content
???
Practice!
--
- Presentation and public speaking skills are trainable
