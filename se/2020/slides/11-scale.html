# Software Engineering
Software engineering at scale

---
## Organizational matters

- 3rd delivery:
    - This week
    - Reminder: precondition for taking the exam is 1.5+ from the first 3 deliveries
???
Pasikartosiu - kelios komandos dar neturi susirinkę 1.5. Metas susitelkti ir susirinkti, kitaip bendrausime ir kitais metais.
- Žodžiu esmė dėl diagramos, kad galite ir ne visos sistemos, o tik pagrindines dalis (kaip jums sakė), bet būtų gerai visos nors tai nėra griežtas reikalavimas šiuo atveju.

--
- Project presentations
    - 2020-12-22 8:30
    - Final lecture after presentations conclude (expected start around 12:30-13:00)
--
- Exam:
    - 2021-01-05 12:00, remote written exam
???
- Dėl turinio patikslinsiu vėliau. Tikėtis atvirų klausimų. Tikėtina, kad per VMA, bet dar patikslinsiu.

---
## Plan

- Today
    - Last time about technical debt and legacy systems
    - What does engineering at scale look like?
    - Software evolution, operations, software engineering in organizations
--
- Remaining lectures
    - (Guest lecture)
    - Professional communication, presenting your work
    - Project presentations and the final lecture
--
- Ad: [Short open lectures by Danske Bank](https://www.facebook.com/events/372419300709234/)
    - First one today @ 17:00 by Vytautas Ašeris

---
## Outages

- Forest logging permit system
    - Retrieving permits for one county did not work
--
    - No big deal
--
- E-health system 2020 July outage
    - Service outage started [07-20](https://www.vz.lt/paslaugos/2020/07/21/registru-centras-atstate-dauguma-sistemudar-neveikia-esvekata)
    - Service restored on [07-29](https://www.registrucentras.lt/naujienos/index.php?mod=news&act=view&id=46466)
???
Dydis: 90 TB duomenų, įkeliama 100k dokumentų per dieną

--
- [AWS 2020 November outage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-web-services-outage-stymies-businesses/2020/11/25/b54a6106-2f4f-11eb-860d-f7999599cbc2_story.html) in US East region
    - Some services impacted for more than 24h
    - Most people in US likely noticed

???
- Wednesday, ~1 day recovery
- $11 bn revenue (LT GDP ~50 bn)
- 45 % cloud services market share
- Consider business cost of outages

---
## Different systems have different properties

- System criticality
    - In how much trouble are we in if it does not work?
--
- System availability requirements
    - "Most of the time"
    - SLAs, e.g. "99.999% requests must be fulfilled in less than 100 ms"
???
Formal and informal requirements

---
## Availability

- Understood from a user's point of view
--
- Is the system *available* right now?
--
- Let's say a system is
    - Not responding at all
--
    - Not responding for 10% of users
--
    - 1% of operations fail
--
    - Some operations take two times longer than expected
--
    - A few non-critical functions do not work

---
## High availability

- [The higher the availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation), the harder it is to achieve
    - Going from 98% to 99% is fairly easy
    - Going from 99.99% to 99.999% is much harder
--
- Achieved through
    - No single point of failure (redundancy)
--
    - Reliable crossover (switching)
--
    - Failure detection (monitoring)
--
- More on this:
    - [Site reliability engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/)
    - [Release It!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_#)


---
## What do outages look like from the inside?

- Small project (~10-20 employees)
    - Client representative calls Project manager
    - Project manager calls one/two key people (developer / infrastructure admin)
    - People investigate, identify problem, think how to mitigate/fix
???
Permanent fix is planned after
--
- A mid-size bank (4000+ engineers)
    - Services categorized by business impact
    - Many roles (development, operations, support, situation management, etc.)
    - Defined processes and metrics
???
SIMA - calls every 30 min with representatives, managers, postmortems
Metrics - number of P0/P1 incidents KPI

--
- Internet-scale company (70 000+ engineers)
    - ???

---
## Trends

- Failures are inevitable
???
Prepare for them! (Release It!)
--
- "The bigger they are, the harder they fall" :)
--
    - More complex failure modes
    - [Cascading failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure)
    - [Grey failrues](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/06/15/gray-failure-the-achilles-heel-of-cloud-scale-systems/)
--
- The more complex the system, the more discipline is required
    - Processes (change management, support, incident response)
    - Metrics
    - Monitoring
    - Automation

???
Things we talk about in this course!

Something has to work starting from exactly yyyy-MM-dd : feature toggles

- Compartmentalization (regions, zones)
- No "big-bang" deployments

---
## Roles within an organization

- Support
    - Answer user questions, help troubleshoot
--
    - Verify and triage incoming problem reports
--
- Operations
    - Monitor if system is running in an acceptable way
--
    - Troubleshoot verified problem reports
--
    - Maintain operating environments
--
- Development
    - Troubleshoot verified problem reports
--
    - Fix defects, prevent performance degradation
--
    - Add new features
--
    - Adapt to new environments, products and standards

---
## Maintenance lifecycle phase

- Commonly perceived as fixing defects only
--
- Includes all of the areas mentioned before (and more)
--
- The most expensive part (around 60-80% TCO)
--
- Out of this, ~80% is due to enhancements, not fixes

---
## Legacy software

- Is useful and successful software that over time became a victim of its own success
--
- Mitigating requires continuous effort. For example:
--
    - Ideas for deeper domain model/better internal design - with every other new feature
--
    - New Java language version every 6 months
--
    - New framework release every ~3-4 months
--
    - New dependency releases every week
--
    - New build tool release every ~1-6 months
--
    - New build server version every ~1 month
--
    - New infrastructure features - constantly
--
    - Third-party API deprecations every ~ year

---
## Key takeaways

- Different systems have different operational requirements
--
- What is high availability and how to achieve it
--
- Maintenance is by far the most expensive lifecycle phase
--
- Maintenance is vital to the long-term success of a system
