# Software Engineering
Zero-feature release (Part 1)

---
## New or noteworthy

- Parliamentary election this week!
--
- Project teams are now formed
--
- Added links in [sample areas of interest](https://emokymai.vu.lt/mod/page/view.php?id=56872) list
--
- Short-term plan - [second delivery](https://emokymai.vu.lt/pluginfile.php/129749/mod_resource/content/1/PSIProjectRequirements2020.pdf):
    - Next 2 lectures - focus on zero-feature release
    - Next 2 lectures - focus on project plan
    - 2nd delivery shortly after that
???
This course starts fast

---
## Before that

- Deadline for first delivery is next week
    - How's it going?

???
- Do you feel you have enough theorethical knowledge to start?
- Is it clear what you have to do?

---
## Zero-feature release

This...
```
 main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
 }
```
--
... and more.

---
## In your case

- A *deployed* minimal version of your app, e.g.:
    - One webpage with static content
    - Mobile app with one "welcome" screen
    - Command-line tool that prints something to console
--
- All team's core technologies are used
--
- Development tools agreed upon and set up
    - At least one automated test exists
    - CI/CD pipeline exists
--
- Infrastructure is operational

???
- Quite a lot to do. Not much "writing code" involved - more like gluing things together.
- Parallelize - start from VCS; then build skeleton that runs locally; while also building from end result.

---
## Why?

- To save you time (less rework, faster development once everything is set up)
--
- To give you more hands-on experience with various tools and practices

## Development infrastructure

---
## Integrated development environments

- Idea: A developer should accomplish everything in one app/program/environment
--
- [What is an IDE?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-ide)
    - Software application that helps developers build software
--
- What does it integrate?
    - Source code editor
    - Local build automation
    - Debugger
    - Other tools (plugins)

???
- Editor demo
    - Code search
    - Quick editing (autocomplete, multiline operations)
    - Incremental compilation
    - Static code analysis, e.g. `Math.max(1, some number)`
    - Consistent formatting (reformat file)
    - Takeaway - learn shortcuts
- Build automation demo
    - Run webapp - compiles, builds, runs
    - Invoke some gradle command (publishToMavenLocal)
- Debugger demo
    - Breakpoints
    - Inspecting values
    - Going back
- Other tools
    - VCS client
    - Terminal
    - SQL client
- Advice - use one IDE with the same settings across the team

---
## Version control systems

- Covered last time

???
Did you have a chance to set it up yet?

---
## Code review tools

- Idea
    - Any code that is submitted must be peer-reviewed
--
- Same as proof-reading an article
--
- Great way to catch problems early, spread knowledge, align style, learn, and teach

???
Some examples:
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/lyra-host-app/pull/10 - teach
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/lyra-host-app/pull/11 - find bugs
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/pv-system-design-service/pull/194 - bounce design ideas ideas
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/pv-system-design-service/pull/394 - no comments
- https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-request-validator/pull-requests/166/add-akka-http-module/diff - another tool
- https://demo.reviewboard.org/r/ - one more tool
- Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180075

## From source to binary package

---
## Build automation tools

- **Main goal**: save time and avoid errors
--
- Secondary goals
    - Dependency management
    - Enforcing process
    - Repeatable builds
--
- Some configuration required
    - Which compiler version to use?
    - Where are the sources?
    - What dependencies are required?
    - ...
--
- Configuration can be *imperative* (steps) or *declarative* (goals)

???
Demo build config: makefile / sh script vs Maven build config

---
## Build config example

```groovy
apply plugin: 'java'
sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_15

repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:2.2.3'
    implementation 'com.github.java-json-tools:json-schema-validator:2.2.14'
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.7.0'
    testRuntime 'com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit5-engine:0.14.1'
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
    exclude '**/*IntegrationTest*'
}
```

???
Demo more complete Gradle config
---
## Dependencies example

<img src="../../assets/10-dependencies.png" width="75%">

???
Demo Gradle dependencies
Demo Node config and dependencies
---
## Aside: Dependencies

- Difference between libraries and frameworks

???
Libraries plug into your code.
Your code plugs into framework.
Do not use two frameworks that serve the same purpose
Frameworks - upgrade path is more complicated

---
## Static code analysers

- Also known as *linters*
--
- Idea
    - Analyze the code *without executing it* to find potential problems
--
- Compilers evolve to include checks from linters
--
- Linters evolve to include new and more complex checks
???
Demo:
- IDEA built-in static analysis
- Sonar, Checkstyle, Findbugs

---
## Automated testing tools

- Various tools that automate testing activities

???
Demo: JUnit, Postman, Selenium

---
## Key takeaways

- Many tools are available - use them to your advantage
--
- Main goal behind automation: save time and avoid errors
--
- Code reviews is an extremely important practice - take them seriously
--
- Declarative configuration is both attractive and popular
