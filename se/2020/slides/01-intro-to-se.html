# Software Engineering
Definition and Introduction

---
## Now

- Overview of software engineering and why we study it

---
## Some alternative definitions

> Multi-person construction of multi-version software.
> <br><br>— <cite>David Parnas</cite>

---
## Some alternative definitions

> The construction of useful IT systems, by teams of people, with limited resources.
> <br><br>— <cite>John Nicholls</cite>

???
Note: "Limited resources"

---
## Some alternative definitions

> The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
> <br><br>— <cite>IEEE</cite>

???
Note: Systematic and quantifiable

---
## First definition

1968 and 1969 - [NATO Software Engineering Conferences](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/Introduction.html)
???
Note: 51 years ago

The motivation for these conferences was that the computer industry at large was having a great deal of trouble in producing large and complex software systems.
--
> Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically,
> software that is reliable, maintainable and works efficiently on real machines.
>
> <br><br>— <cite>Software Engineering: A Report on a Conference Sponsored by the NATO Science Committee, NATO, 1969</cite>

The conferences played a major role in gaining general acceptance for the term software engineering.

## Background

> The phrase ‘software engineering’ was **deliberately chosen as being provocative**,
> in implying the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations
> and practical disciplines, that are traditional in the established branches of engineering.
>
> <br><br>— <cite>Software Engineering: A Report on a Conference Sponsored by the NATO Science Committee, NATO, 1969</cite>

## Why provocative?

Let's look at the definition again:

> Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain
> **economically**, software that is **reliable**, **maintainable** and **works efficiently** on real machines.

--
Notice some hints of software problems of that time:
- Expensive
- Unreliable
- Unmaintainable
- Slow/Inefficient

---
## "The Software Crisis"

- The same conference coins the term "The Software Crisis"
--
- Concerns raised:
   - Problems producing systems on schedule and to specification
--
   - Gap between promises to users and performance achieved
--
   - Seemingly unavoidable fallibility of large software
--
   - More examples of bad large systems than good   
--
   - Demands in the industry going ahead faster than our progress

---
## Dijkstra on software crisis

> The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful!
> To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all;
> when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers,
> programming has become an equally gigantic problem.
>
> <br><br>— <cite>Edsger Dijkstra, The Humble Programmer (EWD340), Communications of the ACM</cite>

## The world of today

- Hardware and resources are efficient, readily available, and cheap
--
- Software is critical to society
--
- Demand for software and expectations for it are ever growing
--
- SE is still a young branch of engineering

---
## At the same time

- Software is extremely expensive
--
- Most projects are delivered over time, over budget or below functionality
--
- Software is often of low quality

--
Basically
- We are still unable to produce or maintain high-quality software at reasonable price and on schedule

## Why is it hard?

- There is no single "right way" to engineer software systems
	- The combination of constraints within a project is probably unique
--
	- Remember: [There is no "best practice"](https://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/5164)
--
- Scale
	- Both systems and organizations producing them are larger
	- Systems rarely exist in isolation
???
Example:
- SolarDesignTool: 3-5 developers over 10-12 years
	- https://get.solardesigntool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/builder-1.png
	- https://get.solardesigntool.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/builder-3.png
- LyraSolar: 2 teams in a company in South America, a distributed core team of 4-5 backend developers, some freelancers

- Communication
	- Distributed
	- Lack of well-understood representations of software
???
----
Note: Lack of well-understood representations of software
--
- The rate of change in the business is higher

---
## Why study software engineering?

- Software is critical to society
???
Note: Both meaning and money (making a living).
--
- The current state of affairs *can* and *should* be improved
--
- Building large software systems is difficult
	- Yet rewarding
	- But doing it without discipline is madness
???
Note: SE protects you mental health
---
## Aspects of software engineering

- Requirements reflecting the real customer needs
--
- Suitable design
--
- Effective and predictable construction
--
- Reliable quality assurance
--
- Safe deployment
--
- Cost-effective maintenance
--
- Organized and predictable project execution

--
In practice SE is mostly about processes, methodologies, and tooling.

---
## Ties to many other fields

- computer science <span class="semi-transparent">(algorithms, data structures, languages, tools)</span>
--
- management <span class="semi-transparent">(project management, scheduling, estimating)</span>
--
- economics/marketing <span class="semi-transparent">(prioritizing investments, pricing)</span>
--
- communication <span class="semi-transparent">(organizational structure, stakeholders)</span>
--
- law <span class="semi-transparent">(compliance, patents, licenses, copyrights)</span>
--
- psychology <span class="semi-transparent">(productivity, personalalities, usability, what is fun)</span>
--
- sociology <span class="semi-transparent">(localization, diversity)</span>
--
- art <span class="semi-transparent">(user interface design)</span>
--
- ethics <span class="semi-transparent">(AI, profiling, use of personal data, public safety)</span>
--
- ...

---
## Key takeaways

- SE is about teams building and evolving high-quality software, while working under constraints unique to their circumstance.
--
- There is no single "right way" to engineer software systems
--
- SE is a "softer" discipline compared to CS
