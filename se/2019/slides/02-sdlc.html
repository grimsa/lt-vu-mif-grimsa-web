# Software Lifecycle Models
Introduction

---
## Today

- Essential tasks of development
--

- What is software development lifecycle?
--

- Some lifecycle models and their tradeoffs

???
- Last time: Overview of software engineering and why we study it

---
## Recap: Problem

- Multi-person construction of multi-version software is a complex undertaking
- Difficult to produce high-quality software at reasonable price and on schedule

???
What can help us manage this complexity?
Define essential activities

---
## Essential activities

--

- Analyzing requirements
--

- Designing software
--

- Implementing software
--

- Testing software
--

- Maintaining software

???
- Each phase requires different tools, knowledge, skillset.
- A lot of ways to split responsibilities.
- How are these related? What is a good order?

---
## Software Process

> A process consists of **a set of** interrelated **activities that transform** one or more **inputs
>  into outputs** while consuming resources to accomplish the transformation.
> -- <cite>SWEBOK 3.0</cite>

---
## We can define many processes

A few examples from ISO 12207:
--

- Acquisition Process
--

- Decision Management Process
--

- Software Requirements Analysis Process
--

- System Architectural Design Process
--

- Software Audit Process
--

- Software Operation Process
--

- Software Disposal Process

???
ISO 12207 - Systems and software engineering â€“ Software life cycle processes

---
## What processes should we use?

--

- Ideal process or set of processes does not exist
--

- Each project or organization should select, adapt, or define their own

---
## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

> **A set of software processes** used to specify and transform software requirements
> into a deliverable software product.
> -- <cite>SWEBOK 3.0</cite>

---
## Software Product Lifecycle (SPLC)

> Software development lifecycle plus all other inception-to-retirement processes.
> -- <cite>SWEBOK 3.0</cite>

???
Deployment, maintenance, configuration management, support, evolution, retirement.

---
## Lifecycle models

> Life cycle models typically emphasize the **key software processes** within the model
> **and their** temporal and logical **interdependencies and relationships**.
> -- <cite>SWEBOK 3.0</cite>

--

In other words:
- A software lifecycle model is a description of **main activities** carried out in a project,
**when** and **in what order** they can be started and finished.

---
## Code-and-fix model

1. General idea
--

1. Ad-hoc development

--
1. Release or time/money runs out

???
Take an informal general product idea and just develop until a product is "ready".

---
## Is this a useful model?

--
It depends.

---
## Code-and-fix model

- Advantages:
    - No overhead / bureaucracy
	- See progress quickly

--
- Disadvantages:
	- Dangerous
		- No way to assess progress, predict timing, or manage risks
		- Unclear scope and quality
		- Unlikely to accomodate changes
	- Impossible for large projects

--
- Consider:
	- For very small projects
	- For short-lived prototypes

---
## What is a good model?

- One that helps us fall into the *Pit of Success*.

--

> *The Pit of Success*: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert
> to find victory through many trials and surprises,
> **we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices** by using our platform and frameworks.
>
> To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.
> -- <cite>Rico Mariani, MS Research MindSwap, Oct 2003.</cite>

---
## What is a good model?

In other words:
- One that leads to better product in less time, with fewer resources

--

Usually through:
- Aiding communication
- Helping judge progress
- Keeping everyone organized

---
## Waterfall model

![Default-aligned image](../../assets/02-waterfall.png)

???
- Circa 1970
- Feedback from next stage

---
## Waterfall model

Single, document-driven linear sequence for all the requirements.

--
- Advantages:
	- Easy to understand and implement
	- Identifies deliverables and milestones
	- Produces comprehensive documentation

--
- Disadvantages:
	- Risky
	- Expensive to change product late
	- Significant administrative overhead

???
- Fits other engineering process models (construction)
- Natural
- Reinforces good habits (define before design, design before code)
- Often unrealistic to expect accurate requirements early in project
- "Swimming upstream" is costly
- Based on assembly line mentality

---
## Waterfall model

- Consider:
	- For complex, but very well-understood projects
	- For large/mature products and weak teams

---
## Spiral model

![Default-aligned image](../../assets/02-spiral.png)

???
- 1988
- Key idea: on each iteration identify and solve sub-problems with highest risk

---
## Spiral model

Waterfall model extended with iterations for managing risks during planning and design.

--
- Advantages:
	- Low risk
	- Reflects iterative nature of development
	- Good project visibility

--
- Disadvantages:
	- Requires expertise in risk analysis and risk management
	- Significant administrative overhead
	- Not commonly used

???
Allows for alternate designs and implementations

---
## Spiral model

Consider:
- When risk management is one of primary concerns

---
## Staged delivery model

![Default-aligned image](02-staged.png)

???
- very practical, widely used and successful
- Waterfall-like beginning with short release cycles following.
- Intermediate deliveries satisfy customers and show progress
- Feedback, problems visible early

Cons:
- Product must be decomposable
- Extra releases cause overhead and require coordination

---
## Design to schedule model

![Default-aligned image](02-schedule.png)

---
## Incremental delivery model

![Default-aligned image](../../assets/02-incremental.png)

???
- In Exploratory development category

---
## Evolutionary prototyping model

![Default-aligned image](02-prototyping.png)

???
- In Throwaway prototyping category
- key idea: customers are non-technical and do not know what they want
- very practical, widely used and successful
- steady signs of progress for customer
- addresses risk of incorrect user requirements
- useful when requirements are not known or changing
- supports early product marketing
- participatory design, close involvent a must
- problems with planning
- temporary fixes become permanent constraints (or unstable prototype becomes final product)
- easy to fall into code-and-fix

---
## Family of Agile models

- Agile is not one model

--
- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

--
- Shared features:

--
	- Continuous incremental deliveries

--
	- Customer collaboration

--
	- Embracing change

--
	- De-emphasised documentation

--
- Examples: Scrum, XP

???
Agile manifesto - 2001

---
## Family of Agile models

- Advantages:
    - Low overhead
    - Emphasizes final product
	- Focuses on teamwork

--
- Disadvantages:
	- Difficult to scale
	- Not always well understood
	- Projects often have fixed scope and budged

???
- Fits small-medium projects and teams well
- Requires close customer involvement

---
## Key takeaways

- Each model is trying to capture how a project should be run

--
- Most are variations of a small number of basic models

--
- There is no ideal model - it's a balance between:

--
	- Risk exposure

--
	- Quality and cost control

--
	- Predictability

--
	- Visibility of progress

--
	- Customer involvement

--
	- Administrative overhead

--
	- Time to market

---
## Key takeaways

- Take these models with a grain of salt, and combine or tailor them to your situation

---
