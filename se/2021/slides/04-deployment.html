# Software Engineering
Deployment

---
## Before we begin

- Deadline for the requirements specification is next week
  - How's it going?
???
- Do you feel you have enough theorethical knowledge to start?
- Is it clear what you have to do?

---
## Goals for today

- Have an idea of the next milestone
--
- Can explain what is design and what is a model
--
- Can read and draw simple UML deployment diagrams

---
class: middle, center
## Zero-feature release

---
## Next milestone: zero-feature release

Let's say you are creating a command-line tool...
--
```
 main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
 }
```
--
... and then
```
> buildTool program.txt program.exe
Build success.
> program.exe
hello, world
>
```
???
- Zero-feature webapp: https://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages/

---
## In your case

- A *deployed* minimal version of your app, e.g.:
  - One webpage with static content
  - Mobile app with one "welcome" screen
  - Command-line tool that prints something to console
--
- All team's core technologies are used
--
- Development tools agreed upon and set up
--
- Infrastructure is operational
--
- Automated deployment process

???
- Quite a lot to do. Not much "writing code" involved - more like gluing things together.
- First step would be to figure out what the system should be like at a high level (technical perspective)

---
## Why?

- To save you time (less rework, faster development once everything is set up)
--
- To give you more hands-on experience with various tools and practices

## High-level design

---
## The basic problem: how?

<br>

.center[Requirements]

.center[↓]

.center[????]

.center[↓]

.center[Code]

---
## It depends

- Small and simple problems
    - Solved with little attention to design
--
- Big and difficult problems
    - Design largely determines how complex software can become

---
## Design

> 1. [**process**] to define the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system element.
> 2. **Result** of the process in (1).
> <br><br>— <cite>Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary, ISO 24765:2017</cite>

---
## Why is design essential for system's success?

- Code is only limited by what people can imagine
--
- However, [human mind is very limited](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/transcending-the-limitations-of-the-human-mind/)
???
How big a codebase can one developer know deeply. 100k LoC?

---
## How to communicate design?

- In a free form
  - Diagrams and drawings
  - Text
  - Tables
--
- Using standard notation
  - **[Unified Modelling Language (UML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)**
  - [The C4 model](https://c4model.com/)

???
We will only be looking at UML in this course, and only at a subset of diagrams.

---
## Models

> A model **represents some aspect of reality** or an idea that is of interest.
> A model is a **simplification**.
> It is an interpretation of reality that **abstracts** the aspects
> relevant to solving the problem at hand and **ignores extraneous detail**.
> <br><br>— <cite>Eric Evans, [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design), 2003</cite>

???
- A model is an abstraction.
- Paralell with memory of some event - "what did you do on the day of your last birthday"? You only remember key details.

---
## Model of average life expectancy

- Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_by_average_life_expectancy_(2015).png
- Life expectancy in a large country (e.g. Russia) varies quite a lot per region, but this model does not take it into account.

---
## More on models

- A model is merely a human construct to help us better understand the real world
--
- We can model what was, what is, and **what could be**

???
- Architects submitting alternative models (ideas) for some to-be building

---
## More on design

- Design is about defining (modelling) a system or system element so that it:
  - achieves the goals
  - satisfies constraints
  - has other desired qualities
--
- Design can be done at different levels
  - With different goals
???
- Design a building, design a lecture hall, design a door handle, design a screw
--
- There are always multiple alternative viable designs
--
- The goal is to choose the best one
  - Analogy with planning - selecting the best possible future

---
## UML deployment diagram

- Static structure of the system at a very high level
--
- Models physical nodes and what artifacts are deployed on them
--
- A few examples:
    - [Clustered webapp](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/web-application-clusters-uml-deployment-diagram-example.html?context=depl-examples)
    - [Small system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram#/media/File:Deployment_Diagram.PNG)
    - [Clustered webapp](https://sites.google.com/site/kampaaniad2016/3-projekt/3-6-uml-deployment-diagram)
    - [Android app](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Deployment-Diagram-for-the-BBS-Android-application_fig6_323704711)

???
- You could practice a software architects role while doing high-level design

---
## Technology choices

> The best framework is the one you already know.
> <br><br>— <cite>Folklore</cite>

--
<br>

> Choose boring technology.
> <br><br>— <cite>Dan McKinley ([blog post](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology), [slide deck](http://boringtechnology.club/))</cite>

???
- Tech choices are also very much the job of a software architect

Tip: Leverage (free) hosted services
- VU resources
- Public clouds (AWS, Google, etc.)

---
## Next

- Have an idea of the next milestone
--
- Draw a deployment diagram for your own system
???
For 2nd and 3rd group you should also figure out if each team will produce a separate artifact or will it be a single one.
