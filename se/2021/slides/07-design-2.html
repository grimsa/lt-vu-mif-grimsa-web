# Software Engineering
UML sequence and activity diagrams

---
## Goals for today

- Can read and create UML sequence and activity diagrams

---
## Recap: UML class diagram

Describes:
- static structure (classes in an OO system)
- (optionally) their attributes and methods
- connections between classes

Does not describe:
- **details of how the classes interact with each other**
- how methods are implemented (algorithmic details)

???
- Example: https://www.uml-diagrams.org/examples/online-shopping-domain-uml-diagram-example.html?context=cls-examples

---
## UML sequence diagram

It is:
- An "interaction diagram"
- The 2<sup>nd</sup> most used UML diagram

???
Interaction diagrams are a subset of behavior diagrams. Emphasize the flow of control.
Usually - how something should be implemented.
--

<span>Describes:</span>

- A single scenario executing within a system
- Who is involved
- What messages are sent
- In what sequence

---
## Example

<img src="../../assets/07-sequence-diagram.png" width="65%">

???
Key terms:
- Lifeline (represents individual participant in an interaction, actor or object)
- Messages
- Execution (activation)

Once again agnostic to programming language used.

Diagram source:

participant Controller
participant Order
participant Shipping Company

Controller -> +Order: dispatch
note over Order: Check if Order can be dispatched
Order -> +Shipping Company: createTrackingId
Shipping Company --> -Order: trackingId
Order -> +Shipping Company: schedulePickup
Shipping Company --> -Order: expectedDeliveryTime
note over Order: Update Order status
Order --> -Controller: expectedDeliveryTime

---
## More examples

- [uml-diagrams.org](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams.html)

???
- Lifelines (named instance vs any instance)
    - Fluency in UML is same as fluency in language - you don't use most words everyday, but they help sometimes.
    Usually people have only basic UML knowledge.
- Reading top to bottom
- Message types (sync - filled arrow, async - white arrow, return - dashed line)
- Repetition - loop - https://www.uml-diagrams.org/online-shopping-uml-sequence-diagram-example.html?context=seq-examples
- If/Else - Alt - https://www.uml-diagrams.org/facebook-authentication-uml-sequence-diagram-example.html
- If - Opt - https://www.uml-diagrams.org/examples/spring-hibernate-transaction-sequence-diagram-example.html?context=seq-examples
- Interaction Use (sequence diagram composition for large sequences)

## Text-based tools

- Example:
   - https://www.websequencediagrams.com/

```
participant Controller
participant Order
participant Shipping Company

Controller -> +Order: dispatch
note over Order: Check if Order can be dispatched
Order -> +Shipping Company: createTrackingId
Shipping Company --> -Order: trackingId
Order -> +Shipping Company: schedulePickup
Shipping Company --> -Order: expectedDeliveryTime
note over Order: Update Order status
Order --> -Controller: expectedDeliveryTime
```
???
Benefits: version control, interoperability

---
## UML activity diagram

It is:
- Also a "behavior diagram"
- Modeling processes (step-by-step activities)

???
Basically a UML-flavored flowchart.
Models contorl flow from one *activity* to another (not object).

--
<span>Describes:</span>

- The overall process
- Activities (actions) that take place
- Decisions that are made

???
Can include both computational and organizational process

---
## Example

- [Fixing software issue](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/software-resolve-issue-uml-activity-diagram-example.html)

???
The most important shape types:

- a black circle represents the start (initial node) of the workflow;
- an encircled black circle represents the end (final node);
- ellipses represent actions;
- diamonds represent decisions;

---
## More examples

- [Process Shopping Order](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/shopping-process-order-uml-activity-diagram-example.html?context=activity-examples)
- [uml-diagrams.com](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/activity-diagrams.html)

???
- bars represent the start (split) or end (join) of concurrent activities;
- Partitions (Swimlanes): https://www.uml-diagrams.org/document-management-uml-activity-diagram-example.html

---
## Summmary

- Both UML sequence and activity diagrams model dynamic (behavioral) aspects of a system
--
- Activity diagrams focus on actions
    - I.e. control flow from one activity to another
???
Especially with potential conditional logic, branching, concurrency, etc.
--
- Sequence diagrams focus on interactions
    - I.e. message flow from one object to another, mostly on a single timeline
???
In other words, interactions between objects
