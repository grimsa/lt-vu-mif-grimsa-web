## Part 1: Failures

---
## Outage examples

- Forest logging permit system
    - Retrieving permits for one county did not work
--
    - No big deal
--
- E-health system 2020 July outage
    - Service outage started [07-20](https://www.vz.lt/paslaugos/2020/07/21/registru-centras-atstate-dauguma-sistemudar-neveikia-esvekata)
    - Service restored on [07-29](https://www.registrucentras.lt/naujienos/index.php?mod=news&act=view&id=46466)
???

- [AWS 2020 November outage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-web-services-outage-stymies-businesses/2020/11/25/b54a6106-2f4f-11eb-860d-f7999599cbc2_story.html) in US East region
    - Some services impacted for more than 24h
    - Most people in US likely noticed

???
- Wednesday, ~1 day recovery
- AWS has $45 bn sales (LT GDP ~$56 bn) (2021 data)
- 32 % cloud services market share (2021 data)
- Consider business cost of outages

---
## Different systems have different properties

- System criticality
    - In how much trouble are we in if it does not work?
--
- System availability requirements
    - "Most of the time"
    - SLAs, e.g. "99.999% requests must be fulfilled in less than 100 ms"
???
Formal and informal requirements

---
## Availability

- Understood from a user's point of view
--
- Is the system *available* right now?
--
- Let's say a system is
    - Not responding at all
--
    - Not responding for 10% of users
--
    - 1% of operations fail
--
    - Some operations take two times longer than expected
--
    - A few non-critical functions do not work

---
## High availability

- [The higher the availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation), the harder it is to achieve
    - Going from 98% to 99% is fairly easy
    - Going from 99.99% to 99.999% is much harder
--
- Achieved through
    - No single point of failure (redundancy)
--
    - Reliable crossover (switching)
--
    - Failure detection (monitoring)
--
- More on this:
    - [Site reliability engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/)
    - [Release It!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_#)

---
## What do outages look like from the inside?

- Small project (~10-20 engineers)
    - Client representative calls Project manager
    - Project manager calls one/two key people (developer / infrastructure admin)
    - People investigate, identify problem, think how to mitigate/fix
???
Permanent fix is planned after
--
- A mid-size bank (4000+ engineers)
    - Services categorized by business impact
    - Many roles (development, operations, support, situation management, etc.)
    - Defined processes and metrics
???
SIMA - calls every 30 min with representatives, managers, postmortems
Metrics - number of P0/P1 incidents KPI

--
- Internet-scale company (70 000+ engineers)
    - ???

???
- At any point in time, something is broken/failing

---
## Trends

- Failures are inevitable
???
Prepare for them! (Release It!)
--
- "The bigger they are, the harder they fall" :)
--
    - More complex failure modes
    - [Cascading failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure)
    - [Grey failrues](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/06/15/gray-failure-the-achilles-heel-of-cloud-scale-systems/)
--
- The more complex the system, the more discipline is required
    - Specialization
    - Processes (change management, support, incident response)
    - Metrics
    - Monitoring
    - Automation

???
Things we talk about in this course! Building a skyscraper vs. building a bicycle shed.

## Part 2: Communication

---
## Communication in general

- Idea → transport → idea
???
Even for the author of the idea! Examples:
- Junior asks a senior about things, figures out as they ask
- Rubber duck
--
- Losses everywhere!
???
- Netiksliai išsireiškiau
- Autocorrect'as ištaisė / ne viską užkrovė / ne viską perskaitė
- Ne taip perskaitė
- Ne taip suprato (sąvokos/mental modeliai skirtingi)
--
- Competing ideas everywhere!
???
Other ideas competing for attention
--
- Goal: getting the *right* idea across
--
???
All forms:
- spoken (conversations, meetings, presentations)
- written (chats, emails, documents, books), etc. Manuals, memos, meeting minutes, laws.

---
## The cost of communication

- 15 people, daily 15 min meeting = ??? EUR
???
- Then add some buffer to join/leave/get a coffee
- 20 days per month
- 50 EUR/h rate

--
- 2 people, building an app for 2 months = ??? EUR
???
- 2x 160h
Ruby app was scrapped and had to be rewritten in Java
???
Discussions - 126h this year - https://track.toggl.com/reports/summary/2253729/clients/42738614/description/Discussion/period/thisYear/users/3523559

--
- A project that is delayed... and delayed... and delayed
???
Likely a communication problem (final scope not known, or required effort not known)

--
- Two people of equivalent skill, except for communication. Salary difference?

---
## Trends

- Scale, specialization, and higher complexity requires more coordination
--
- Remote work is pushing more and more communication into async (written, recorded)

---
## Some tips for effective communication

- Universal
--
    - Relevant to the audience
???
Who is going to attend? What do they need to know? What is your goal? What is the main thing you want to communicate?
--
    - Short, and to the point
???
Less is more. "I did not have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead".
In the context of presentations - if time limit is 10 minutes, aim for 5-7 mins instead.
Do not rush.
--
    - Structured
???
- Have a clear, simple, minimal structure.
- For repetitive communication it should also be consistent.
- Example: weekly report status
- Every meeting should have a clear purpose, outcome, and preparation
???

--
- Other
    - Practiced
???
Preparation is key. Practice - time with a clock, film yourself.
Presentation and public speaking skills are trainable
--
    - Open to feedback
???
- Discussions - everyone should contribute their ideas to a shared pool of meaning
- Conflicts: push vs. pull. 2x Push = standoff
--
    - Balanced between fact and feeling
???
When trying to convince. Visi mes žmonės ir ryšį su kitais žmonėm ar net idėjomis kuriame per jausmus.
--
    - Using one strong argument to justify a point
???
When trying to convince. Kartojimas ar papildomi argumentai "atskiedžia" ir susilpnina (be to, tada opozicija gali atsakyti į silpnus argumentus).
--
    - Recorded
???
At least the decisions should be documented and published
