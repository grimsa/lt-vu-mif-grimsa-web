# Software Engineering
CI and CD

---
## Before we begin

- 2nd delivery

---
## Recap from DevOps lecture

- Software needs to be delivered to customers faster than ever
--
- Manual operations (e.g. deployment) is not really an option
--
- Some of the values:
  - Continuous fast feedback
  - Determinism in delivery
--
- Processes and tools are means to achieve those values
--
- Some practices:
  - Strong version control
  - Automate everything (pipelines)
  - Zero-touch build and deploy

???
Let's talk some more about build and deploy

---
## Basic problem
<br>
.center[**Source code**]

.center[|]
.center[*????*]
.center[↓]

.center[**Software available to end-user**]

--
<br>
<br>
.center[Ideally, instantly and automatically]

---
## Two main steps

.center[**Source code**]

.center[|]
.center[*build and package*]
.center[↓]

.center[**Some binary artifact**]

.center[|]
.center[*deploy*]
.center[↓]

.center[**Software available to end-user**]

???
Last time we talked about build tools. Let's take it further.

### CI

---
## Continuous integration (CI)

An almost universally used practice.

--
- Maintain a code repository
--
- Commit to baseline (main branch) often
???
- Often - ideally, multiple times per day. In any case you should not have branches that live for longer than 1-2 days.
- Goal: minimize "work in progress".
- Example: https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/permit-ready-pv-system-design/pulls
--
- Build every commit automatically
???
- Should happen on another machine - in a deterministic environment
--
- The build should be fast and self-testing
???
- If tests fail, you can not integrate your changes into the baseline.
--
- Make everyone aware of the results of the latest build
???
- E.g. send email/notification that something failed. Fixing a failing build is top priority.
- Physical alarms / flashing lights
--
- Make the artifacts produced accessible for use, testing and deployment

???
Goals - avoid conflicts between developers, minimize work in progress.

---
## Build infrastructure

- Executes builds, runs tests, performs static code analysis, etc.
- Maintains status/history, and notifies developers
- Can be
  - A dedicated server (e.g. Jenkins)
  - Cloud-native (e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)

???
- Demo: Jenkins

### CD
---
## Continuous delivery/deployment

- Expand on ideas of CI
--
- Both referred to as CD
--
- Continuous delivery
    - Every working version **can be** deployed
--
- Continuous deployment
    - Every working version **is** deployed
--
- Typically implemented as a pipeline
???
- Pipeline - a sequence of processing steps/elements, where output from one step becomes input to the next one.

???
- Demo: Deployment of some service to prod
- Pipeline as code example: https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/jenkins-shared-library/blob/master/vars/microservicePipeline.groovy
- Demo: https://github.com/grimsa/lt-vu-mif-grimsa-web/actions
- Demo: https://github.com/grimsa/logging-permit-scraper/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml

---
## Deployment environments

<img src="../../assets/10-envs.svg" style="margin: -50pt 0 -50pt 60pt" width="90%">
???
- An environment where (into which) a software artifacts are deployed
- This can include
    - Hardware
    - Operating system
    - Any required software
    - Any required configuration
--
- Local/Development
    - Developer's own environment
--
- Integration/Test
    - Latest baseline build deployed automatically
--
- Staging/Acceptance/Pre-production
    - Production replica for release candidate testing or production troubleshooting
--
- Production/Live
    - Main environment with real users

???
- Typically we want multiple instances of same thing with slightly different configuration.
- Sometimes we want short-lived environments.
- Provisioning them automatically simplifies things.

---
## Infrastructure as code

- Managing and provisioning servers through config files
    - Rather than physically configuring machines using interactive tools
--
- Goal: save time and reduce errors
--
- Enabler: apply development practices to config files
    - Files can be versioned, branched, reviewed, released, etc.
--
- Example ([Terraform](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/blob/master/examples/two-tier/main.tf))

???
Example:
- https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/aws-infrastructure/
- https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks

---
## Containers

- Containers are the primary vehicle of deployment
    - *Docker* being the primary (underlying) runtime
???
Another thing mentioned in DevOps presentation was containers.

Demo:
- Dockerfile (https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/load-serving-entity-service/blob/develop/Dockerfile)
- ECR and maybe ECS (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories/private/724586101605/load-serving-entity-repo?region=us-east-1)    
--
- Container benefits
    - Portability
    - Developer productivity
    - Low overhead
--
- Deployed either on cloud container services or on your own infrastructure
