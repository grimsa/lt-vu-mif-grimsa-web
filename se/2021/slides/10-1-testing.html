# Software Engineering
More on testing

???
- The last time Janis talked about testing in general
- A few practical aspects + a bit about automation

---
## Goals

- Can write test cases for simple functions (and automate them)

---
## Software testing

- Everyone who develops software does testing
--
- Testing is *running* the program with *selected inputs* and checking that *actual* results match *expectations*
--
- We can do it *at random* or *systematically*

---
## Example: Print constant text

```
class MyProgram {
    public static void main() {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

--
- Always behaves the same way
--
- Expected output: constant `Hello, world!`
--

Testing is trivial

---
## Example: Twice the number

`<T extends Number> T twice(T number)`

--
- `T` is `Byte`
   - Inputs [-128; 127]
   - Input space: 256 different values
--
- `T` is `Long`
   - Inputs [â€“9,223,372,036,854,775,808; 9,223,372,036,854,775,807]
   - Input space: 1.8e19 different values
--
- `T` is `BigInteger`
   - Input space: (loosely) infinite
--

Testing with all inputs is not **possible** or **feasible**

---
## Input selection

- How do we choose which inputs to test with?
--
    - *Test case* = particular choice of input data + expected outcome
--
- Random selection is not efficient
--
- Fundamental idea
    - Correct results for tested inputs should be representative of correct results for untested inputs
--
- There are heuristics that help us choose (*test case design*)
--
    - Equivalence groups (black-box)
    - Boundaries (black-box)
    - Control flow (white-box)
    - States (white-box)
---
## Equivalence groups

Test cases for `int sqare(int number)`?

--

Idea
- A fault in code often affects a whole group of similar inputs
- It's unlikely that values within the same group of similar inputs produce different results

--

Therefore
1. Partition input space into logical equivalence groups
2. Choose input values from each group

???
E.g. positive, negative, 0

---
## Boundary conditions

Test cases for `int sqare(int number)`?

--

Idea
- Faults are more likely at the boundaries of equivalence groups
    - E.g. confusion between `>` and `>=`, and other *off-by-one errors*

--

Therefore
- Choose input values at the boundaries
- Choose "special" values (`null`, `0`, min/max values, etc.)

???
- Max positive, 1, 0, -1, min negative

---
## Control flow

```
public static int foo(int a, int b) {
    int result = 5;
    if (a > 15) {
        result = a;
    }
    return b > 10
       ? result + b
       : result - b; 
}
```

--

Idea
- A piece of code has a finite number of different paths through it

--

Therefore
- Choose inputs that exercise every path

---
## Demo

- ASCE 7-16 wind zone generation

???
- A good showcase of an engineering approach
- Context: Roofs - https://slideplayer.com/slide/17660078/ - edge types + plan view
- Context: Cain and banks PDF
- Context: Permit package - what is the end result
- Variety of roofs: https://www.google.com/maps/place/506+Viterra+Ct,+Kissimmee,+FL+34759,+USA/@28.1293695,-81.4922752,64m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88dd9ddf9248bd4f:0x5032e97b99490ee3!8m2!3d28.1294018!4d-81.4922125
- Initial approach was to implement this for two simplest roof types, and then take a random roof, and support it in full. Led to edge-cases.
- Breaking a problem down into smaller parts: https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GTG/pages/1505984515/ASCE+7-16+wind+pressure+zones
- There is no algorithm how to end up with "correct" answer
- Process is (e.g. https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/browse/LYRA-5506 or uncommitted):
    - Find examples / list variations
    - Add test case
    - Run it, verify results (snapshots)
    - If something wrong - fix the code
- Takeaways:
    - Value-driven prioritization (based on data)
    - Measurable progress (at least X%): https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GTG/pages/1514962989/Weekly+team+meeting+11+12+2021
    - Not possible to implement such feature with sufficient quality without automated testing
    - Too many combinations possible to be able to regression-test manually
    - Confidence that types implemented previously still work - makes it easy to fix bugs or add new types

## Testing assignment

- [Unit testing/TDD assignment](https://emokymai.vu.lt/mod/page/view.php?id=106829)

???
- Take a little time to reflect:
    - Did you experience a situation where the test case for the new requirement passed, but some of the previous test cases failed?
    - After you had the initial testing program, did adding new test cases take little time compared to implementing the requirement?
    - Did you feel differently writing code this way compared to how you usually feel when writing code?
    - Did you perceive a difference of outcomes between this process of writing code and your usual process (in terms of e.g. code quality, or time it takes to implement things)
