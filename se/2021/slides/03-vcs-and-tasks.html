# Software Engineering
Selected tools

---
## Before we begin

- Pre-course questionnaire
???
- TODO - compile an overview: https://emokymai.vu.lt/mod/questionnaire/report.php?instance=8&group=0
-----
--
- [1st delivery requirements](https://emokymai.vu.lt/mod/page/view.php?id=28602)
???
- Two weeks, go. Best try to do something in a week, and then get feedback.
--
- A random productivity tip - get a second screen
???
- I assume most of you are using laptops or desktops with a single screen
- If that is the case, I highly recommend investing into a second screen
- A used 24 inch screen costs around 40-50 EUR.
- The cheaper models often can not pivot, but not everyone is into that.

---
## Goals for today

- Have a basic understanding of how to use git
--
- Have some ideas how you could track and organize tasks in your project
--
- Know of some other useful tools

---

## Version control systems

---
## The need

> SE = *Multi-person construction of multi-version software.*

--
Notice some challenges...
--
- Multi-person
  - What changed since the last time I checked?
  - Who has the latest version of file X?
  - What if I need to edit file X today?
--
- Multi-version
  - What changed between version 1.0 and 1.2?
  - Who wrote this!?!
  - Why do we have this code?
???
- The answer might as well be yourself, 6 months ago :)

---
## There's a tool for that

**Version control system** - a software tool that helps manage changes to (source code) files over time.
???
- Alternative term "SCM - Source Code Management"
- No reason why it can not manage any kind of files, e.g. data

--
- State of the practice
  - Every non-throwaway project uses VCS
--
  - *git* is the dominant VCS
???
- Random post on the internet claims ~70% market share in 2020
- Others: SVN, Mercurial, CVS, Jazz, etc.

---
## git

- Command-line application
--
  - But GUIs exist
--
- Some resources
  - [Official docs](https://git-scm.com/doc)
  - [A decent tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/d-learn-workings-git/)
???
- Nice videos

---
## Key concepts and commands
- Repository
???
- `git init folder`
- Repository is just a folder that has some "special" folder for git metadata
- Can already be imported in GUI client
-----
--
- Diff
???
- `git diff`
- Diff = Comparison between two versions
- Show in GUI
-----
--
- Staging area
???
- `git add .`
- Show in GUI (can stage selected parts)
- Staging area - you choose which files participate in the next commit
-----
--
- Commit
???
- `git commit -m "message"`
- Commit = A change set that is made permanent
- Every commit has a message, and also an author and ID (hash)
- Show Figure 3 from guide
-----
--
- History
???
- Make several more local commits, show history
- Show Figure 4
- Show pv-system-design-service history (develop branch only)
- This was linear history for now
-----
--
- Branch
???
- `git checkout -b feature`
- Branch - some particular (named) track of history
- Can have multiple branches with different changes
-----
--
- Tag
???
- `git tag v1`
- git commit something
- git checkout v1
-----
--
- Checkout
???
- git checkout {tag, branch, commit hash}
- Open file in notepad
- Show commits with multiple files
-----
--
- Merge
???
- Merge = Inclusion of changes from one branch into another
- Merge feature branch into develop
- Figure 5 / Figure 6
- `git merge feature` while we are on `master`: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge

---
## Collaboration using git

- One repository is treated as the source of truth
???
- Runs on some always-available remote server
--
- Everyone has its own local repository (a clone)
???
- A clone of the remote one
- Everything works offline (you have a full copy)
--
- Everyone regularly synchronizes with that one remote repository
    - `git push`
    - `git pull`

---
## Git repository hosting

- Dominant providers:
  - [GitHub](https://github.com)
  - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [VU has an instance](https://git.mif.vu.lt)
--
- Both also provide additional services/tools

---
## Branching models

- [Trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/)
--
- [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

???
- Demo of trunk-based development
- Create repo
- Clone
- Checkout branch, commit something, create PR, write review comments
- checkout develop
- checkout another feature branch, commit something, create PR

---
## Some tips

- Practice keeping history useful
???
- Small changes, well described, linked to issues
git is more like a journal of the changes, rather just one big blob of changes at the end of the day (backup).
Good messages is extremely helpful of getting context of why changes were made and who made them.
--
- Version everything
--
  - Text-based formats are superior
???
- Example: these slides @ https://github.com/grimsa/lt-vu-mif-grimsa-web
- If you notice any grammatical or other mistakes - please create a pull request :)
--
  - Avoid storing derived/compiled resources
???
- `.gitignore`
--
  - Never store secrets like passwords, secret keys, etc.
--
- Pick one branching model and stick with it
--
- Practice code reviews
???
- One of the best ways to grow your skills
- Do not forget it is about code, not people (not "you are stupid", but "this code could be better if written like this, because reasons")
- Example: https://github.com/SolarDesignTool/math-applications/pull/77

---
## VCS in practice

- Basic questions
  - What changed recently?
???
- `git pull` and then check recent changes
--
  - Who wrote/knows about this section of the code?
???
- Git history for a single file
--
  - Who changed what in the code, when did it happen and for what reason?
???
- Git blame
--
- (Archeology demo)
???
- https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/blob/master/logback-access/src/main/java/ch/qos/logback/access/spi/AccessEvent.java
- Search Image suppressed
- Blame twice, click on commit
- End up here: https://github.com/qos-ch/logback/commit/69290e182f8db6589eadd5a3c485a37255384893

## Task management

---
## Basics

- Task
  - Describes specific things to be done
  - A lot of those
--
- Roadmap
  - Milestones/releases/versions
--
- Tags/labels
  - Helps filter/search for tasks
--
- Boards
  - Visualize work

???
Demo:
- A single task:
  - Feature: https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/browse/LYRA-595
  - Bugfix, visual: https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/browse/LYRA-5306
  - Bugfix, technical: https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/browse/LYRA-5223
  - Unclear (placeholder): https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/browse/LYRA-272
  - Each task has an ID, and an assignee
- Task backlog (list): https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9&projectKey=LYRA&view=planning.nodetail&issueLimit=100
  - We have a lot of tasks (400+ open, 4000+ resolved). Need some way to organize them / focus on smaller parts
- Roadmap - different versions: https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GTG/pages/1423638536/Product+Roadmap
  - Each task can be assigned to a version
  - Versions then help track progress and stay focused: https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/projects/LYRA?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page
- Filtering
  - Based on versions and tags - in list
  - Based on assignee
- Boards - visualize work that is currently relevant
  - https://solardesigntool.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9&projectKey=LYRA

## Recreating the same in GitHub

- Tasks → Issues
- Roadmap → Milestones
- Tags → Labels
- Boards → Projects

???
- Labels and milestones: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/labels
- Boards in same project: https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/23, https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/20
- 
- Other tools possible too

---
## Tips

- Keep track of all tasks
--
- Prefer small tasks, e.g. that you can complete in 4 hours
--
- Prioritize - create the first milestone and separate tasks that are relevant now and later
--
- Distinguish between fixes and new features
--
- For larger teams
  - Tag issues with your team's area
  - Visualise progress in separate boards
???
- Keeping a whole-project board can be a good idea too

## Other tools

---
## Collaboration

- Documentation
???
- Requirements
- How to do something
- Explanation
- Reference
- Can be in code, next to docs
- Markdown!
- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/requirements/
--
- Messaging (MS Teams)
???
- Multi-channel/thread messengers. We use Slack, but MS teams does the same.
- If you want private channel created - let me know.
--
- Whiteboards ([Miro](https://miro.com), [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com))
--
- Time trackers ([Toggl](https://track.toggl.com))
???
- Could be a useful input to compare with internal evaluation results
