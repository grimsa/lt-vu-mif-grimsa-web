	- How do you feel about remote?
	- Is English challenging? Did you have any courses in English before this one?
	- Interaction tools - write in chat
- Start recording

---
## Goals for today

- Course overview
	- Can describe the course at a high level
    - Know the structure of the grades
    - Know where to find information
--
- Software engineering
	- Can explain what it is in your own words
	- Can name some complexities of building software

---
## Software Engineering - what is it?

???
- Software is somewhat clear (one or more program(s))
- Engineering is less clear
- Activity - word cloud? What is engineering?

--
This course is about **_engineering_** software.
--
> ### verb: engineer
> 1. to plan, build, or manage (something) by using scientific methods.
>     - "The system is engineered for maximum efficiency."
--
> 2. to produce or plan (something) especially in a clever and skillful way.
>     - "a brilliantly engineered plan"
>
> <br>— <cite>[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/engineer)</cite>

???
Engineering is not science.
Engineers are not a sub-category of scientists.
Discovery is the essence of science.
Engineers innovate solutions to real-world challenges in society.
While it is true that engineering without science could be haphazard; without engineering,
cientific discovery would be a merely an academic pursuit.

## Software Engineering - a metaphor

???
- "Pasive house" is just a very energy efficient house
- Built in a different way - more complicated than just "go and build it"
- In practice SE is mostly about processes, methodologies, and tooling.
--
- Building software *is not a mere matter of programming*
--
- No successful software remains small and simple

"I'd like to add two bedrooms, a bathroom and a living room to my bike shed"

---
## Software Engineering - teaching

- Primarily taught through simulation and hands-on experience
???
Pretty much all courses I've seen involve some kind of a group project.
As enginering is about solving real-world problems, it makes sense to simulate that.
--
- Who am I to teach?
---
<img src="../01-self-wh.png" width="70%">

???
- I identify as a software engineer. It is a big part of my life.
- But - keep in mind - I'm not smarter than you. I've just had more time to practice.
- I had the priviledge of good education, coupled with 10 years of hands-on professional experience.
- If it is something you want, in 10-15 years you can be company founders, managers, CTOs, lead developers, lecturers, book authors, speakers at conferences, etc.

---
## Course format: Lectures

- Every week
--
- Online***
--
- Discuss essential ideas and practices
--
- Sometimes there will be material to read/watch before or after
--
- Might have a guest speaker towards the end of the semester

---
## Course format: Projects

- Whole semester
--
- Work in teams to build useful software
--
- Simulation of a real project
--
- Should give you both technical and social challenges
--
- Weekly consultations to present intermediate results, receive advice, and earn marks
--
- Run slightly differently in different groups

???
- Group one (Innovative applications) will practice on their problem-based-learning project
- Groups two and three will each do a single project. Next step will be choosing a project topic - until Friday!

---
## Final grade structure

- 25% - Project documents
- 25% - Developed system prototype
- 10% - Project presentation
- 40% - Exam

???
Documents - 2.5:
- 0.75 + 0.25 - requirements
- 0.75 + 0.25 - design document
- 0.5 - project reports
- The first delivery is about figuring out what needs to be done and documenting that

Prototype - 2.5:
- 1 Whole system + 1 team part + 0.5 individual part
- 1 Whole system + 1 PSI practices + 0.5 individual part

Presentation - 1:
- Last week of studies.
- Presenting to a jury + your colleagues.
- Exact details will be clarified.

Exam - 4:
- Precondition for taking the exam - 1.25 from documents
- In writing, possibly in person
- Strictly individual
- Covers both course material and your project
- Not only recall the theory, but be able to reflect and apply it
- Example will be provided
- Best result = 4 marks, others proportionally

Any questions?

---
## More practical matters

- The course starts fast
- Proposal: Move one lecture from end of semester to next week

???
Quick poll with reactions for yes/no. If OK, then I can propose times.

## First definition

1968 and 1969 - [NATO Software Engineering Conferences](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/Introduction.html)
???
Note: 51 years ago

The motivation for these conferences was that the computer industry at large was having a great deal of trouble in producing large and complex software systems.

Notice some hints of software problems of that time:
- Expensive
- Unreliable
- Unmaintainable
- Slow/Inefficient

---
## 50 years later...

- Software is *extremely* expensive
--
- Most projects are delivered over time, over budget or below functionality
--
- Software is often of low quality

--
Basically
- We are still unable to produce or maintain high-quality software at reasonable price and on schedule

---
## Why is it hard?

- There is no single "right way" to engineer software systems
	- The combination of constraints within a project is probably unique
--
	- [There is no "best practice"](https://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/5164)
--
- Scale
	- Both systems and organizations producing them are larger
	- Systems rarely exist in isolation
???
Example:
- SolarDesignTool: 3-5 developers over 10-12 years
- LyraSolar: 2 teams in a company in South America, a distributed core team of 4-5 backend developers, some freelancers

--
- Communication
	- Distributed
	- Lack of well-understood representations of software
???
----
Note: Lack of well-understood representations of software
--
- The rate of change in the business is higher

???
Something difficult = opportunity
