# Software Engineering
Software process, life cycle models, methods

---
## Goal

- Able to name at least a few different software life cycle models
- Knows some likely consequences of choosing a particular life cycle model

---
## Software crisis

- Recap: "The Software Crisis"
    - Term coined in the NATO Software Engineering Conference (1968)
--
- Standish Group reports:
    - [1994-2000](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~gmp/docs/papers/extreme_chaos2001.pdf)
    - [2011-2015](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf)
    - 2016-2020

???
- Problems producing systems on schedule and to specification
- https://hennyportman.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/project-success-qrc-standish-group-chaos-report-2020.pdf
- 2020 - succ 31%, challenged 50%, failed 19%

---
## Quality

- Product quality
    - Quality of the end result (software)
--
- Process quality
    - One of a number of contributors to product quality
--
- Software (product) quality is usually either unsatisfactory, or satisfactory, but at great cost
--
- Naturally, we turn to process quality improvments

???
- Process quality improvements were largely successful in other industries.
    - More precise, more consistent (repeatable)
- Process improvement is largely domain agnostic.
    - Banking software, games, etc.

---
## Software process

- Ideal software process
???
LT: "Programų kūrimo procesas"
--
    - Is predictable (cost, schedule)
--
    - Produces software of sufficient quality
--
- Intially software process research focused on process assessment and improvement
    - [SW-CMM predecessor (1988)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=2014&casa_token=hIvssq46ACQAAAAA:qNnRd-dPN2KBdwuNzSZDt9_tWLus3WbMPQWO6nO9qhIlrJNH1pCY8nsSJsM8dNWqJJVMn-449A&tag=1)
    - [CMM levels](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Characteristics_of_Capability_Maturity_Model.svg)

- Assessment: Where do we stand now?
- Improvement: What do we need to do to get to the next level?

## Code-and-fix

1. General idea
--
1. Ad-hoc development
--
1. Release or time/money runs out

???
Take an informal general product idea and just develop until a product is "ready".
Is this a useful process? It depends.

---
## Code-and-fix

- Advantages:
    - No overhead / bureaucracy
--
    - See progress quickly
--
- Disadvantages:
	- Dangerous
		- No way to assess progress, predict timing, or manage risks
		- Unclear scope and quality
		- Unlikely to accomodate changes
--
    - Impossible for large projects
--
- Consider:
	- For very small projects or short-lived prototypes

---
## What is a good process?

One that leads to better product in less time, with fewer resources.

Usually through:
- Aiding communication
- Helping judge progress
- Keeping everyone organized

## Evolutionary periods

1. "The Wild West" (1960-1980)
1. Waterfall (1980-2000)
1. Agile (2000-2020)
1. Flow (2020-?)

<i>(Based on [a paper from the Standish Group](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339943530_Go_with_the_Flow_Envisioning_a_Successful_Pipeline_of_Software_Projects))</i>

???
- Just an opinion
- The dates are approximately where it is at its peak / dominant

---
## Waterfall
<img src="../../assets/02-waterfall.png" width="70%">

???
- Software development lifecycle model (main stages/activities and relations between them)
- Single, document-driven linear sequence for all the requirements.
- Source: http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/lectures/Lecture11/royce1970.pdf
- Circa 1970. Royce is often credited, but he neither used the term "waterfall" nor portray it as desired
- Fits other engineering process models (construction, assembly line)
- Feedback from next stage

---
## Waterfall

- Single, document-driven linear sequence for all the requirements.
--
- Advantages:
	- Easy to understand and implement
	- Identifies deliverables and milestones
	- Produces comprehensive documentation
--
- Disadvantages:
	- Risky
	- Expensive to change product late
	- Significant administrative overhead
???
- Natural
- Reinforces good habits (define before design, design before code)
- Often unrealistic to expect accurate requirements early in project
- "Swimming upstream" is costly
- Customer value at the end of the project only
--
- Consider:
	- For complex, but very well-understood projects
	- For large/mature products and weak teams

---
## Agile

- Agile is an umbrella term
--
    - Methods evolved during the 1990s
--
    - [Agile Manifesto (2001)](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
--
- Shared features:
--
	- Continuous incremental deliveries
--
	- Customer collaboration
--
	- Embracing change
--
    - De-emphasised documentation
???
Lightweight. As an opposite of heavyweight methods (collectively often referred to as waterfall)
--
- Examples: [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#/media/File:Scrum_Framework.png), [Kanban](https://d112uwirao0vo9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Explicit-Policies-in-Kanban-Board-1024x613.png), XP

## Iterative and incremental

<img src="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/iterating.jpg" width="80%">

???
- In the picture: Spiral model (1988): Waterfall model extended with iterations for managing risks during planning and design. Key idea: on each iteration identify and solve sub-problems with highest risk
- Iterative model would start with an initial, simplified implementation, which progressively gains more complexity. One iteration in prorgess at a time.

Iterative (metaphor: getting a tailor-made dress/suit made):
- Pros: low risk, flexible - easy to adapt to changes, little administrative overhead, widely used, optimizes early feedback
- Cons: visibility is not great (how many iterations remain?), difficult to plan
- Use: for continuous product development / improvements

--
<img src="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/incrementing.jpg" width="80%">

???
- Metaphor: three-course meal (serve one in full, then serve another).
- We build the part that is fully clear, then clarify and build another part and so on.
- Mutliple increments can be in development in parallel.
- Pros: very practical, widely used and successful, intermediate deliveries satisfy customers and show progress, feedback, problems visible early
- Cons: Product must be decomposable, if not - risk of suboptimal architecture
- Exploratory development category

Incremental can be mixed with iterative (to deliver successively refined increments)

---
## Agile methods

- Advantages:
    - Low overhead
    - Emphasizes final product
	- Focuses on teamwork
--
- Disadvantages:
	- Difficult to scale
	- Not always well understood
	- Projects often have fixed scope and budget

???
- Fits small-medium projects and teams well
- Requires close customer involvement

---
## Flow / continuous product development

- Successful software is continually developed and improved
???
- Example: systems in a bank - some 20+ years old, all actively maintained
--
- Projects are not the optimal way to continuously develop a software product
    - [#noprojects](https://www.allankelly.net/archives/595/noprojects-why-projects-dont-make-sense/)
???
Yet funding was often project-based
When I say "the project I'm working on", I mean "the product I'm working on" :)
--
- Continuous long-term development:
    - by a stable team
    - with a stable budget
    - focusing on business value
    - delivering continuously
    - at a sustainable pace

---
## Highlights

- Better software processes lead to better software products
--
- A perfect software process would be perfectly predictable
--
- There is no "best" way to run a project - pick or tailor to balance between:
--
	- Risk exposure
--
	- Predictability
--
	- Customer involvement
--
	- Administrative overhead

---
## Reading assignment

Recommended:

- Two lists: [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [Agile Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
- Paper: [W. Royce. Managing the Development of Large Software Systems](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/lectures/Lecture11/royce1970.pdf)

Extra:

- Some notes about [Modern Agile](https://modernagile.org/)

???
- Notice similarities between Royce and Agile
