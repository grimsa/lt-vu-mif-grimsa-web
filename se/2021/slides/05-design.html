# Software Engineering
Architecture | Design

---
## Before we begin

- 1st delivery
--
- Next week: guest lecture about DevOps

---
## Goals for today

- Can identify some of the architectural decisions in your system
--
- Can explain information hiding in your own words
--
- Can read and create UML class diagrams

---

## Architecture

???
- We talked a little bit about the design the last time and about the high-level view of a Deployment diagram.
- It was defined as "[a process] to define the architecture, system elements, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or system element." or as the result of such process.

---
## Architecture

- A few informal definitions
--
  - "The important stuff — whatever that is"
???
- 1. Decisions that have high impact on the system and its stakeholders
--
  - "Things that are expensive to change later"
???
- 2. Decisions that "have to" be right the first time.

---
## Exercise: architecture of a house

- Let's say we're building a house
- Which decisions would be "architectural decisions"?

???
- Oh, I want an extra room for work
- I want to add a window to a bathroom
- New requirement: I want to have extra electrical outlets on a wall where there are none
- Constraint: I have trouble walking up and down the stairs
- Locations for pipes/plumbing/communications hidden in the walls

- Links:
  - Something like this: https://www.roomsketcher.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RoomSketcher-Custom-2D-Floor-Plan-Branding.jpg
  - Architectural views: https://mano.eika.lt/uploads/apartment/draw/2019/12/90554cea70e0dfbde95f5f64bf1d146d5f61a871.pdf

- A designer generates alternative designs and evaluates them. There is no single "right" design/architecture.

## Architecture

> A software architecture is a **description** of the **subsystems** and **components**
> of a software system and the **relationships** between them.
> <br>[…]<br>
> The software architecture of a system is an artifact that results from the software **design** activities.
> <br><br> — <cite>[Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85039.Pattern_Oriented_Software_Architecture_Volume_1), 1996</cite>

--

Essentially a set of **components** and **connectors** at a software system level; a blueprint for a software system.

---
## So where to start?

Always start with the problem.
--
> **Without requirements** that your solution must fulfill, all **design** work […] **is just guessing** at best.
> <br><br> — <cite>Frank Buschmann, [SE Radio podcast E54](https://www.se-radio.net/2007/04/episode-54-interview-frank-buschmann/)</cite>

--
Already familiar first steps:
--
- System requirements
--
- System context diagram
--
- System deployment diagram

???
Let's take some time to discuss what success would look like

---
## Qualities of a good design

- First of all, it must fulfil the requirements
--
- Then, it should:
    - Help **manage complexity**
    - Support distribution of work
    - Support future changes
???
- Recall: limitations of the human mind    
--
- All of the above lead to *modularity* and *separation of responsibilities*

---
## On modularity

- Fundamental cost in SE is accomodating change
--
- A change that modifies multiple components is more costly than a change that is isolated in a single component
--
- Therefore
  - components and interfaces should capture stable aspects
--
  - implementation details should capture changeable aspects
???
- Interface vs. implementation
--
- More on this: [Parnas: On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules](https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/05/on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules/)

???
- Information hiding.
- "Every module in is characterized by its knowledge of a design decision which it hides from all others.
Its interface or definition was chosen to reveal as little as possible about its inner workings."

---
## Caveat

- You cannot create a design that anticipates **all** changes
--
  - Analogy with packing things in a backpack
???
- You can not make everything easily accessible
- More of a design example: making engine easily serviceable
--
- Therefore, anticipate **likely** changes

---
## So what can we hide?

- Algorithms
???
- 1. Sorting algorithms
--
- Data representations
???
- 2. CSV/XML/JSON/EXCEL - just a file with data
--
- Sources of information
???
- 3. COVID statistics - portal / open data
--
- Hardware specifics
???
- 4. Plug and play: same interface / different drivers (implementations)
--
- Specifics of external API or external domain
???
- 5. Old file system: file name must be 8 symbols or fewer -> shorten file names to `Abcde~1.ext`

All of these together might be called "business logic" - i.e. all the details of how the business works.

---
## Bezos API mandate

???
Getting back to the architectural decisions.
--
- Internal memo at Amazon (~2002) by Jeff Bezos (CEO)
--
- Best known from when an ex-Amazon employee accidentally posted his rant to a wider audience
--
- Secondary sources:
    - [Just the API mandate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18916406)
    - [Same with more context](https://gigaom.com/2011/10/12/419-the-biggest-thing-amazon-got-right-the-platform/) 

---
## Bezos API mandate

> - **All teams will henceforth expose** their data and functionality through **service interfaces**.
--
> - Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
--
> - There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. **The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.**

---
## Bezos API mandate (2)

> - It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, CORBA, PubSub, custom protocols -- doesn't matter. Bezos doesn't care.
--
> - **All service interfaces, without exception, must be** designed from the ground up to be **externalizable**. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
--
> - Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.

--

Notice principles:
- Information hiding
- Reusability

## UML class diagram

???
A way to document the static structure of the domain model / implementation

---
## UML class diagram

Describes:
- static structure (e.g. classes in an OO system)
--
- (optionally) their attributes and methods
--
- connections between classes

???
Agnostic to programming language used.

Examples:
- https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/pages/chart/class-diagram-for-hotel-management-system-UML/UML_class_diagram_hotel-949x683.PNG
- https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/
- https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams-overview.html

--

Does not describe:
- details of how the classes interact with each other
--
- how methods are implemented (algorithmic details)

---
## Some tips

- Focus on responsibilities and behaviour, not on data
--
- Classes representing the domain model should do all domain work
    - Rich (instead of anemic) domain model
--
- Avoid duplication (DRY)
    - A change should be limited to one place
--
- Prefer composition over inheritance

---
## Next

- Task: Identify the important architectural decisions in your system

- Guest lecture about DevOps
