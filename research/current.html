# My research interests

I am interested in sustainability and how it relates to software.

I find it important because:

- Modern societies are consuming resources at an unsustainable rate;
- The total amount of resources (matter, energy, and human) used to build and run software is increasing over time.

One of the resources linked below identifies the following top-level directions:

1. *Software for sustainability* - designing and building specialized software that directly supports [UN sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)
2. *Sustainable software* - designing and building software of any purpose while considering sustainability goals
    1. Improving the sustainability of the software development process (how software is built)
    2. Improving the sustainability of the software system (how the produced software behaves, and what qualities it has)

Out of these two, the second direction seems to be both more widely applicable, as well as better aligned with the area of studies in our institute/department.

So what could we do to improve significantly? So far I find these directions promising:

- Better design and architecture (=> solutions that are simpler, easier to maintain, and systems that can be in service longer)
- Reuse (=> building something again and again is a waste)
- Function-as-a-Service computing model (=> fewer servers needed)
- Efficient delivery process (=> less effort wasted, faster delivery)

Some general resources:

* [No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident in Software Engineering](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf)
* [Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering](https://principles.green/)
* [What does Sustainability mean *in* and *for* Software Engineering?](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Birgit_Penzenstadler/publication/255949741_What_does_Sustainability_mean_in_and_for_Software_Engineering/links/00b49520e7541932dd000000.pdf)

Naturally, this is quite abstract and high-level. But take a look at a few select ideas below.

# Potential research topics

The descriptions below are just initial introductions.

If you are interested, send me an [email](mailto:gediminas.rimsa@mif.vu.lt), do some research of your own, and then let's discuss what exactly you would be working on.

Note that I'm the most comfortable with the following tech stack: Java, Spring Framework, JPA, RESTful APIs, AWS, etc. - keep this limiation in mind if your work would require significant technology-specific guidance.

### Object-oriented programming

I believe that object-oriented (OO) approach to building software systems works exceptionally well for complex business domains.
Yet there are relatively few systems that could be called "mostly object-oriented" (let alone "truly object-oriented").

What could we do to make it easier to improve the state of practice and build truly object-oriented systems?

There are many potential directions here, just to name a ideas that come to my mind first:

- Identifying the "right" guiding principles/rules that should be followed, and then building tools that help enforce them
- Measuring the "object-orientedness" of a system, and identifying positive or negative design decisions in an automated way
- Proposing ways to use popular frameworks and libraries in a way that would complement, and not violate the OO principles
- Mining the knowledge of the past (e.g. works of Alan Kay, Smalltalk programming language, etc.) for insights that could be widely applied in today's software development

The following resources may help get a glimpse at what OO code could look like:

* OO basics/examples:
    * [Example 1: Modeling accounts and currencies](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/03/12/object-oriented-solutions-accounts-and-currencies/)
    * [Example 2: Avoiding getters](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/object-oriented-solutions-avoiding-getters/)
    * [Example 3: Readable model](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/04/11/object-oriented-solutions-readable-design/)
    * [Example 4: Avoiding nulls](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2018/11/24/why-i-never-null-check-parameters/)
    * [Example 5: OO-style poker hands calculator implemented in a step-by-step way (in separate commits) with commentary added in each commit](https://github.com/grimsa/practice--poker-hands)
    * [On abstractions](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/transcending-the-limitations-of-the-human-mind/)
* Additional ideas on design/architecture for OO applications:
    * [A pretty good summary of how OO relates to DDD](https://speakerdeck.com/robertbraeutigam/object-oriented-domain-driven-design)
    * [On layered architecture and how it breaks OO](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/reevaluating-the-layered-architecture/)
    * [On data-oriented boundaries and how they break OO](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/data-boundaries-are-the-root-cause-of-maintenance-problems/)
    * [On organizing classes into packages](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/happy-packaging/)
* (Optionally) Everything else in these two blogs:

### Domain-driven design

Domain-driven design originates from a classic book that describes an approach of designing complex systems at two levels:

- Tactical - what types of objects should the system have (somewhat similar to layers);
- Strategic - how to organize large models.

At the tactical level, the proposed approach is similar to the object-oriented one, yet certain ideas seem to diverge from an OO approach.
It would be interesting to know, whether these divergences are essential or accidental, and how the tactical design ideas of DDD could be integrated with a truly object-oriented approach.

At the strategic level, it would be interesting to see how these ideas should be reflected in practice, e.g. in a Microservice/FaaS setting (where each unit of deployment is possibly a small part of a domain model).

### Your topic

See another problem on the way to sustainability?

Maybe something is painfully not efficient/wasteful? Or maybe you see how software could guide decisions towards sustainability?

Please reach out, so we can find a way how to make it into a research topic.

### A few more potential topic ideas (not that thought-out yet)

* Semantic release
    - Integrating it into delivery pipelines for Java libraries/microservices/serverless functions (proposed tech: Gradle and GitHub Actions)
* Software maintainability
    - How can we measure it?
* Mining valuable insights from previously popular technologies
    - For example, 30 years old [CORBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture)
* Identifying dead code in Java projects
* Various problems related to dependency management
    - Avoiding unused optional dependencies (Gradle feature variants and capabilities may be useful for this)
    - Detecting changes in transitive dependency versions
* Minimizing deployable software artifact size
