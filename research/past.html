# Some of the student research works from past years

- Automated detection of OOP principles violation (2021)
    - Primary result - a tool to detect SRP and LSP violations in Python code
- Automated detection of architectural rule violations (2020)
    - Primary result - a tool similar to [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) except for TypeScript
- Automated source code migrations (2019-2020)
    - Idea: describe code migration once, apply in multiple codebases
    - Primary result: [a tool for describing .NET migrations](https://github.com/tomasmuzas/Refresh.NET)
- Measuring the Complexity of a Software System (2019)
    - How can we measure how complex a system is? Can we determine objectively if a change is increasing or decreasing overall complexity?
- Code Reuse in ICO Smart Contracts (2018-2019)
    - Idea: ICO smart contracts could have been considered a software product line
    - Primary question: How could one organize code reuse in such a setting?
