# Some of the student research works from past years

- Criteria for evaluating system decomposition methods (2023)
	- Research question: If we apply some decomposition method, we get some kind of decomposition as its output - how can we assess the quality of that output?
- Adapting Niklas Luhmann's Card Indexing System for Software Documentation (2023)
	- Research question: Would it be feasible to use atomic networked notes to document software systems?
- Software Delivery Performance Measurement (2023)
	- Research question: How can a small and resource-constrained organization pragmatically measure its software delivery performance?
- Feature based Java code packaging strategy variations and support tools (2022)
	- Research question: What feature-based Java code packaging strategies exist, which of them are the most promising, and how can we enforce them using tools?
- Automated detection of OOP principles violation (2021)
    - Primary result - a tool to detect SRP and LSP violations in Python code
- Automated detection of architectural rule violations (2020)
    - Primary result - a tool similar to [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) except for TypeScript
- Automated source code migrations (2019-2020)
    - Idea: describe code migration once, apply in multiple codebases
    - Primary result: [a tool for describing .NET migrations](https://github.com/tomasmuzas/Refresh.NET)
- Measuring the Complexity of a Software System (2019)
    - How can we measure how complex a system is? Can we determine objectively if a change is increasing or decreasing overall complexity?
- Code Reuse in ICO Smart Contracts (2018-2019)
    - Idea: ICO smart contracts could have been considered a software product line
    - Primary question: How could one organize code reuse in such a setting?
