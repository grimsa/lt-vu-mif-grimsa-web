# Research topics

Research topics currently offered:

- Java packaging strategies
- Computer-aided design of solar energy systems
- Your topic

The descriptions below are just initial introductions.
If you are interested, send me an [email](mailto:gediminas.rimsa@mif.vu.lt), do some research of your own, and then let's discuss what exactly you would be working on.

## Java packaging strategies
- The way Java code is organized into package hierarchies plays an important role in mid-size or larger systems
- Different packaging principles exist: "package by feature", "package by layer", etc.
- Some package hierarchies likely have measurably better qualities compared to others
- Some questions for your curiosity:
    - What are the most prevalent packaging strategies and what are their underlying principles?
    - What qualities does a "good" package hierarchy exhibit?
    - For any given package hierarchy, could we measure how "good" it is?
    - For any given package hierarchy, could improvements be suggested? Could they be prioritized?
    - If we establish a package hierarchy and packaging principles, how could we ensure that the system does not deviate from them over time?
    - Etc.

## Computer-aided design of solar energy systems
- One of my clients is developing a computer-aided design tool in solar energy domain
- Some areas of that tool are quite complex and challenging
- Your goal would be to pick a problem, research it, and then propose (and implement) a solution. Comparing it against an existing one might also be possible.
- Some example problems:
    - Building up a 3D model of a roof from a given 2D projection
    - Generating an optimal layout of PV modules on a given roof
    - Estimating annual energy production for a given PV system
    - Etc.

## Your topic
- Are you curious about something? Do you see an intersting problem nobody seems to be solving?
- It might be a suitable topic for your research
- Think of the following:
    - Problem - what problem/pain point/inefficiency do you see in the world?
    - Goal - which part of that problem would you try to solve/address/make better? You don't have to solve the whole problem.
    - Expected results - what would be an ideal outcome at the end of your research?
- Bonus points if:
    - It's a cross-discipline topic, esp. related to sustainability, education, mental health, etc.
    - It's a technical topic about software design, maintainability, reuse, evolution over time, or anything that helps build software smarter
    - Your preferred implementation language is Java
