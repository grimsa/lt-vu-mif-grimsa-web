## Online resources

A few select resources I recommend exploring:

* [The New Java Developer](https://javadevguy.wordpress.com/) blog
    * A great resource about fondamental ideas of object-oriented programming and how to apply them in Java code
    * I often refer to this blog when mentoring younger software developers
* [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) blog
    * A blog that summarizes/reviews various fresh and classic computer science research papers
    * I often recommend it to students as an accessible resource to get familiar with the mindset around scientific research, the structure of papers, and also to get a feeling of where the latest scientific research is focused, and also to discover areas they are curious about.
